Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
 
 
 
2023 was overshadowed by wars, political turbulence and economic uncertainty. Commerzbank had a very 
successful financial year despite this challenging environment. We continued to make great strides on the path 
we embarked on three years ago with “Strategy 2024”.  
We have now completed what is probably the most comprehensive restructuring in the Bank’s history, 
including a gross reduction of almost 10,000 full-time equivalents and deep cuts in our branch network. This 
means we have achieved the core goals outlined in the “Strategy 2024” programme, bringing our cost base 
back to a competitive level. At the same time, last year saw us establish our new business model on the 
market.  
We are an omnichannel bank for all customer groups. In our business with private and small-business 
customers, we offer the best possible service on all channels based on a clear two-brand strategy built around 
Commerzbank and comdirect. This is how we best meet the different needs of our almost 11 million private 
and business customers in Germany. We have optimised our digital offerings and successfully rolled out our 
advisory centre as a location-independent service to complement to our now significantly leaner, branch-based 
business. Our particularly wealthy customers have access to customised solutions tailored to their specific 
needs. In short, we have found a setup that works for modern banking in Germany. 
In the corporate customer business, the focus is on meeting the needs of German corporate clients and 
international customers with links to Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The same applies to companies from the 
growth sectors of tomorrow, and holds equally true for institutional customers. Commerzbank is the leading 
Mittelstandsbank in Germany and recently regained its top ranking as the leading principal bank in the German 
Corporate Clients segment. With a well-established relationship management model for these customer groups 
and industries coupled with a global presence that covers all trade corridors relevant to the German economy, we 
will continue to expand our strong position in this segment. Like in the Private Customers segment, digital 
services also play a crucial role for corporate customers. With that in mind, we took targeted action to expand 
this offering last year. Our efforts had the desired effect, with two thirds of our corporate customers now using 
online channels – and the trend continues. 
The figures speak for themselves: our strategy is working. In the 2023 financial year just ended, we earned more 
than we have earned at any time in the past 15 years, both in operating terms at €3.4bn, and in consolidated terms at 
€2.2bn. With a return on equity ratio (RoTE) of 7.7%, we have already reached the target set for 2024 a year earlier 
than planned. This was bolstered by the very dynamic performance on the earnings side, propped up not least by the 
interest rate trend. Parallel to this, we maintained our proven cost discipline and were able to improve the cost income 
ratio to 61% last year. This means that we are almost at the level originally targeted for 2024 for this important key

figure. Loan loss provisions also developed favourably, finishing the year significantly lower than initially expected 
despite the high overall level of economic uncertainty and the weak economy in Germany. This is further evidence of 
the resilience of our customer business and the high quality of our loan book.  
All in all, we can say that Commerzbank is doing well in its new setup. It is in very good shape, has returned 
to sustainable profitability in its operating business, and has a very solid balance sheet with a Core Tier 1 ratio 
of 14.7%. We want to further expand our focus as the bank for Germany – and do so across all channels. Our 
hard work over the past few years has significantly improved the conditions for us to remain a defining force in 
the German banking market. 
Our successes are gaining increasing attention and recognition. Trust in Commerzbank is growing, both 
within the Bank, where a spirit of optimism is progressively emerging among our employees and managers, as 
well as outside it, where our reputation has made noticeable gains and where we are also receiving a lot of 
support from investors. This upward trajectory is further underlined by our return to the leading German share 
index, the DAX, at the beginning of last year and our solid ratings. 
Based on our significantly improved profitability, not only are we in a position today to make the necessary 
investments for the future, but we once again have the financial strength for a dynamic distribution policy, 
through which we offer our shareholders an appropriate share in the Bank’s success. 
Last year, with a dividend of €0.20 per share and an initial share buyback programme amounting to €122m, 
we achieved a payout ratio of 30% of consolidated profit after deducting AT1 coupons. Now, as announced, we 
want to increase this ratio to 50% on the back of a significantly increased dividend payment compared to the 
previous year and an additional share buyback. The 2024 buyback programme of up to €600m, which was 
approved by the ECB and the German Finance Agency last December, started on 10 January. As already 
communicated, the Board of Managing Directors and Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General 
Meeting on 30 April 2024 a dividend for the 2023 financial year of €0.35 per share for the remaining shares.  
Dear shareholders, the fact that we are in a position to put all of this into practice is testament to 
Commerzbank’s regained self-confidence and strength. This is due not least to the exceptional abilities and 
tireless commitment of our employees, who give their best day in, day out for Commerzbank and for our 
customers. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of the entire Board of 
Directors.  
We have already accomplished a great deal together. But this is no time to rest on our laurels. Quite the 
contrary, Commerzbank is far from having reached its full potential. As we emerge from the tough 
restructuring of the past few years, supported by our new, sustainable and forward-looking business model, 
we have earned and created the opportunity to go back on the offensive. The updated strategy programme 
presented last autumn sets out how we intend to do this from now until 2027. Growth – Excellence – 
Responsibility: these are our strategic pillars for the years ahead.  
We have devised a package of measures and initiatives we can apply to our excellent products and 
services to achieve profitable growth in our two customer segments. Above all, we want to increase 
commission income so we can become more independent of the interest rate environment. In addition, we 
will continue to streamline and digitalise our processes, maintain our strict cost discipline and use our 
capital efficiently.  
In the Private and Small-Business Customers segment, Commerzbank’s Asset and Wealth Management 
and comdirect will be our key drivers of growth. We also intend to further expand and optimise digital 
products and services for our customers. In the Corporate Clients segment, we will continue to expand our 
leading market position as a Mittelstandsbank, even faced with the current difficult economic environment, as 
we help to shape the sustainable restructuring of the German economy. As a solution provider, we want to 
actively support this transformation process and the associated financing needs with a comprehensive range 
of advice and products.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
With our updated strategy communicated on 8 November 2023, we are sending a clear signal to the market and to 
the competition that we want to position ourselves as a defining force in the German banking market. We have also 
announced ambitious financial targets, combined with our clear and continuing aim to create value for our 
shareholders in the years ahead. 
We aim to increase Commerzbank’s net profit to €3.4b by 2027 and progressively improve the return on 
equity ratio (RoTE) to more than 11%. In this way the Bank will earn its cost of capital. The key performance 
indicator remains the cost income ratio, which we want to improve to around 55% by 2027. A target of 13.5% 
is set for the Core Tier 1 ratio. On this basis, the plan is to return more capital to shareholders in the coming 
years, with a payout ratio in excess of 50% planned for 2025–2027, albeit not exceeding the consolidated 
profit after deducting AT1 coupons. At the same time, we are keeping the pace of investment high: we will 
continue to make more than  
one half a billion euros available per year for investments in expanding our business and in developing our own 
infrastructure and regulations. 
In the current year, we want to inch closer to our medium-term goals – in spite of the expected slight 
recession in Germany, in spite of the ongoing inflationary pressure on our costs, and in spite of the fading 
tailwind from interest rates. With all due caution, we have decided to reduce the cost income ratio to around 
60% and increase the return on equity ratio (RoTE) to 8%. The payout ratio for 2024 should be at least 70% 
as defined by the policy on returning capital, but not more than the consolidated profit after deducting AT1 
coupons. 
Dear shareholders, Commerzbank is back on the road to success. And just at the right time! Because now, 
more than ever, our customers need a strong, reliable partner by their side. Faced with the wars in Ukraine 
and in the Middle East, the climate crisis, the rise of the right-wing populists, budget crises, rising energy 
costs, inflation, recession, fear of creeping deindustrialisation; we are not turning a blind eye to all of this -– 
we are doing something about it. Our message is: Moving forward – and what better time than now! We want 
to encourage our customers to embrace the urgently needed green and digital transformation and give the 
tools they need to help them. We want to be an attractive employer for our employees that offers them a 
working environment to be entrepreneurial. And we want to fulfil our social responsibility by further 
advancing sustainable financing and investments. 
We can say and do all of this because we are strong again. And because we know what we have to do to 
make sure things stay this way. We are firmly convinced that Commerzbank has what it takes to be the bank for 
Germany, to help shape the sustainable transformation of the economy together with its customers, and to 
continue the success story it has just begun – for the benefit of all of its stakeholders.  
We would be delighted if you would continue to join us on this journey and put your trust in us.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
Commerzbank continued to consistently implement its strategy and transformation in the 2023 financial year, 
not only significantly developing the Bank’s business model but also in large parts already achieving the 
targets it had set for 2024. With a successful 2023 financial year, Commerzbank is laying the foundations for 
its “Moving Forward” strategy, which aims at growth, excellence and responsibility. In addition to the 
financial results, it focuses on customer and employee satisfaction. The Bank has also created the 
prerequisites for further capital distributions to its shareholders. This is a commendable achievement for the 
Bank, given the political disruptions and ongoing uncertainties, as well as the associated geopolitical, 
business and economic dislocations.  
The Supervisory Board advised the Board of Managing Directors and supervised and monitored its 
management as it tackled the multifaceted challenges of the 2023 financial year. The Board of Managing 
Directors reported to the Supervisory Board promptly, extensively and at regular intervals on the major 
developments at the Bank, including in the periods between meetings. The Supervisory Board received 
frequent and regular information on the Bank’s business, economic and risk situation, the considerations 
relating to the Bank’s strategic alignment, its corporate planning, its sustainability strategy, compliance and 
cyber risk issues, loan loss provisions and the Bank’s risk strategy, and discussed these issues with the Board 
of Managing Directors. The Supervisory Board and its committees held a total of 42 meetings in the past 
financial year. Between meetings, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board was also continually in touch with 
the Chairman and other members of the Board of Managing Directors according to a set timetable and kept 
up to date with the current business progress, strategic considerations, the risk situation, risk management, 
compliance issues and major business transactions within both the Bank and the Group.  
The Supervisory Board was involved in decisions of major importance for the Bank, giving its approval 
after extensive consultation and examination wherever required. 
Meetings of the Supervisory Board 
A total of ten Supervisory Board meetings (seven ordinary and three extraordinary meetings) were held 
during the past financial year. In preparation for these meetings, the shareholder representatives as well as 
the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board regularly held separate preparatory meetings. A

particular focal point of the Supervisory Board’s work was to monitor implementation of the “Strategy 2024” 
programme. The Supervisory Board therefore received reports on the Bank’s strategic transformation on an 
ongoing basis. Another focus was on supporting the development of the “Moving Forward” strategy. The 
Supervisory Board was kept fully informed by the Board of Managing Directors about the ongoing 
development of the strategy and was involved in an advisory capacity. The Board of Managing Directors 
intensively discussed the Bank’s new strategic direction with the Supervisory Board and separately with the 
shareholder and employee representatives during a total of two strategy days in 2023. Strategic issues were 
also regularly discussed in the meetings. 
The Supervisory Board monitored the Bank’s financial and business performance and risk situation closely. 
It also considered the consequences of the war in Ukraine for the Bank on an ongoing basis. 
The Supervisory Board dealt intensively with personnel issues, in particular the appointment of a new 
member of the Board of Managing Directors. It also considered the composition of the Supervisory Board 
with respect to the shareholder representatives and submitted corresponding election proposals to the 2023 
Annual General Meeting. 
The Supervisory Board also dealt closely with matters at mBank during 2023, in particular the risks for 
Commerzbank arising from mBank’s Swiss franc loan portfolio.  
The focus of all ordinary meetings was the Bank’s current business position, which the Supervisory Board 
discussed intensively with the Board of Managing Directors. The Supervisory Board considered in depth the 
financial and business performance of the Bank and its business segments, the risk situation, the strategy and 
its implementation status along with the strategic transformation, planning, compliance and tax issues, 
regulatory audits, the risk management system, the internal control system and cyber risks. The Supervisory 
Board regularly discussed a range of issues where the Board of Managing Directors was not present.  
It subjected the reports of the Board of Managing Directors to analysis, in some cases requesting 
supplementary information, which the Board of Managing Directors provided. The Supervisory Board also 
received information on internal and official investigations into the Bank, asked questions regarding these 
and formed an opinion.  
The meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees, except for extraordinary meetings scheduled 
at short notice, were convened as face-to-face meetings, however virtual participation was always made 
possible via video conference. 
Where resolutions were required between meetings or it helped to ensure efficient organisation of the 
Supervisory Board’s work, the Supervisory Board adopted resolutions by way of circulars. 
Where the Supervisory Board deemed it necessary, it brought in consultants to assist it in its activities. 
 
The following specific topics were discussed at the Supervisory Board meetings: 
 
At the extraordinary meeting on 12 January 2023, the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board 
nominated their candidates for proposal to the 2023 Annual General Meeting for election. In doing so, they 
took into account the skills and expertise profile and the suitability matrix for the Supervisory Board as well 
as the objectives adopted by the Supervisory Board for its own composition. 
 
At the meeting on 15 February 2023, the Board of Managing Directors reported in detail on the current 
business situation and the progress made with the transformation, the preliminary results for the 2022 financial 
year and the results for the fourth quarter of 2022. Compliance and cyber security issues were discussed. The 
Board of Managing Directors presented the Bank’s new brand campaign to the Supervisory Board. The findings 
of a commissioned market research study and the measures derived from this by the Board of Managing 
Directors were also discussed with the Supervisory Board. The Board of Managing Directors and Supervisory 
Board discussed the Bank’s dividend policy, and the Supervisory Board approved the Bank’s buyback of its own 
shares. In addition, the Supervisory Board dealt in its February meeting with the 2023 sub-risk strategies for 
credit, market, liquidity and operational risks as well as the cyber risk and information security strategy. The 
Supervisory Board agreed the variable remuneration for members of the Board of Managing Directors for the

2022 financial year. It also extended the appointment of Michael Kotzbauer to the Board of Managing Directors. 
Additionally, it addressed the Supervisory Board report, the declaration on corporate governance and the 
remuneration report for 2022. The results of the evaluation of the Board of Managing Directors and Supervisory 
Board, which had been carried out internally within the Bank, and of the Supervisory Board’s self-assessment 
for the 2022 financial year were presented and discussed, and resulting measures were resolved. The 
Supervisory Board also declared its intention to elect me as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, provided I was 
elected by the 2023 Annual General Meeting.  
 
At the accounts review meeting on 22 March 2023, the Supervisory Board approved the 2022 financial 
statements for the parent company and the Group following a report by the Board of Managing Directors, a 
recommendation from the Audit Committee and a discussion with the auditor. In this context, the auditor 
presented the results of its audits to the Supervisory Board and discussed them with the Supervisory Board. The 
Supervisory Board concurred with the recommendation made by the Board of Managing Directors on the 
appropriation of profit. The Supervisory Board considered the accounting process, the internal control system 
and the risk management system and discussed the assessments of the Board of Managing Directors and the 
auditor regarding their appropriateness and effectiveness. On the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the 
Supervisory Board determined that there were no objections to be raised with regard to the separate non-
financial Group report under Art. 315b of the German Commercial Code (HGB) or the non-financial report 
under Art. 289b HGB, even after the final results of its own reviews. The Board of Managing Directors reported 
to the Supervisory Board on the current business situation and on developments relating to mBank. The Board 
of Managing Directors and Supervisory Board also discussed the Bank’s strategic direction in detail. Human 
resources issues were discussed with the Supervisory Board as well. The Supervisory Board approved the 
notice and agenda for the 2023 Annual General Meeting as well as the proposed resolutions for the Annual 
General Meeting contained therein. The Supervisory Board approved Commerzbank AG’s remuneration report 
under Art. 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) for the 2022 financial year. The Board of Managing 
Directors reported to the Supervisory Board on the “Simply Simpler” project, which aims to contribute to the 
sustainable reduction of complexity at Commerzbank. 
 
Following the Annual General Meeting on 31 May 2023, the Supervisory Board elected me as Chairman of 
the Supervisory Board and Uwe Tschäge as Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board at its constituent 
meeting on the same day, each for the duration of our respective terms of office as Supervisory Board members. 
The Supervisory Board also appointed the members of its committees. On the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee, the Supervisory Board determined the focal areas of the audit for 2023 and resolved to appoint 
KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (KPMG) to audit the non-financial report for the 2023 financial year. 
 
At the extraordinary meeting on 20 June 2023, the Supervisory Board resolved to launch a new search to 
fill the position of Chief Risk Officer after Rüdiger Rass decided, following discussions with the banking 
supervisory authority and in agreement with the Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board, 
that he was no longer available for this position and would instead continue to hold his previous position as 
Chief Credit Risk Officer of Commerzbank. 
 
At the meeting on 6 July 2023, the Board of Managing Directors reported to the Supervisory Board on the 
current business situation, the status of the strategy process, the progress made with the transformation, the 
results of an internal management staff survey and compliance issues. Against the backdrop of the ruling of 
5 June 2023 of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on loans issued in foreign currencies, the Supervisory 
Board again discussed matters at mBank in detail – in particular the risks for Commerzbank arising from 
mBank’s Swiss franc loan portfolio. The Board of Managing Directors also reported on the current status of 
the “Simply Simpler” project. The Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board additionally 
discussed the target state and the alignment of Commerzbank’s IT in detail. The Supervisory Board was 
consulted on the extension of the appointment of the Remuneration Officer. On the recommendation of the

Compensation Control Committee, the Supervisory Board resolved to engage the auditor KPMG to check the 
accuracy of the content of the remuneration report for the 2023 reporting year under the German Stock 
Corporation Act (AktG), in addition to ensuring that it meets the legal requirements set out in Art. 162 (3) AktG.  
 
At the extraordinary meeting on 11 September 2023, the Supervisory Board appointed Bernhard Spalt as 
Chief Risk Officer with effect from 1 January 2024, subject to approval by the regulatory authority. 
 
At the Supervisory Board meeting on 26 September 2023, the Board of Managing Directors reported 
to the Supervisory Board on the current business situation, in particular the business situation in the two 
customer segments, the results of the second quarter and the first half of the year, and the result of the 
EBA stress test. The Supervisory Board discussed the Bank’s Russian business and approved the 
amendment to the Articles of Association with regard to the reduced share capital. The Supervisory 
Board also discussed matters relating to the Board of Managing Directors, including further development 
of the structured succession planning for the Board of Managing Directors. 
 
At the meeting on 27 September 2023, the Supervisory Board debated the “Moving Forward” strategy 
presented by the Board of Managing Directors in detail and intensively discussed strategic issues relating to 
the segments and divisions and to IT, as well as the financial targets, with the Board of Managing Directors, 
and made suggestions on these topics. The Supervisory Board summarised these results at its meeting on 
28 September 2023, exchanged views with the Board of Managing Directors again on individual strategic 
points and made final suggestions and recommendations. It also discussed the policy on returning capital that 
the Board of Managing Directors had presented.  
 
At the last meeting of the year on 23 November 2023, the Board of Managing Directors presented its 
planning up to 2027 as well as its business, risk, IT and outsourcing strategy to the Supervisory Board, which 
acknowledged them after detailed discussion. As part of its report on the business situation, the Board of 
Managing Directors provided information on the progress made with the transformation, the business 
situation in the two customer segments, the current risk situations, cyber risk and compliance issues, and the 
delivery organisation as well as the results of the employee survey conducted in 2023 and the management 
staff’s feedback. The Supervisory Board approved the Bank’s buyback of more of its own shares. The 
Supervisory Board received reports on the Bank’s business activities in Russia and the planned further 
development of variable remuneration for pay-scale and non-pay-scale employees. Strategic issues were 
again discussed with the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board set the targets to be achieved for the 
variable remuneration of the members of the Board of Managing Directors for the 2024 financial year, 
reviewed the appropriateness of the remuneration of the Board of Managing Directors and determined that 
the remuneration of the Board of Managing Directors was appropriate in terms of the requirements of the 
German Corporate Governance Code and taking other contractual factors into account. Another topic 
discussed at this meeting was the Bank’s corporate governance. In particular, the Supervisory Board 
approved the annual declaration of compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code pursuant to 
Art. 161 AktG, examined at the independence of the members of the Supervisory Board, set objectives for its 
own composition, and adopted diversity policies for the composition of the Board of Managing Directors and 
the Supervisory Board as well as the suitability matrix for the Supervisory Board. More details on corporate 
governance at Commerzbank can be found on pages 25 to 35 of this Annual Report. Finally, the Supervisory 
Board reviewed the performance evaluation of the long-term incentive component of the variable 
remuneration of former members of the Board of Managing Directors for past performance years by means 
of a retrospective assessment. 
Committees 
In order to perform its duties efficiently, the Supervisory Board has formed seven permanent committees 
from among its members.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
The current composition of the committees is shown on page 17 of this Annual Report. The duties 
and responsibilities of the individual committees are defined in their rules of procedure, which can be 
found online at https://www.commerzbank.com. 
 
The Audit Committee held five ordinary meetings in the 2023 financial year. It held discussions with the 
responsible members of the Board of Managing Directors on the financial statements for the parent 
company and the Group and the interim financial statements. Additionally, it discussed financial information, 
the development of the key financial indicators, the principles of accounting and the accounting process. It 
also dealt with the major business transactions, provisions for mBank’s Swiss franc loan portfolio, and the 
outlook for further business development. On the basis of these discussions, the committee decided on the 
recommendations to the Supervisory Board about the adoption of the parent company financial statements 
and the approval of the Group financial statements.  
The committee received explanations from the auditor about the results of the audit of the financial 
statements of Commerzbank’s parent company and the Group and the accompanying auditor’s reports. It also 
received regular reports from the auditor on the current status and individual results of the annual audit of 
the financial statements, as well as the results of the audit reviews of the interim reports and of the separate 
financial information. Discussions in the committee centred on the focus areas for the audit and the key audit 
matters identified by the auditor. To safeguard the economic independence of the auditor, the Audit 
Committee obtained and discussed the auditor’s declaration of independence pursuant to Art. 6 of the EU 
Audit Regulation. The committee also dealt with requests for the auditor to perform non-audit services and 
received a report on this from the Group Finance department responsible for monitoring. The committee also 
discussed the quality of the audit, both internally and in consultation with the auditor. The committee 
assessed the quality of the audit based on a range of sources including an Audit Quality Indicator Dashboard 
and a detailed survey among the committee members, management and the departments that also work with 
the auditor. On this basis, the Audit Committee submitted proposals to the Supervisory Board regarding the 
appointment of the auditor, the amount of the auditor’s fees and the key audit matters, and the appointment 
of an auditor for the combined separate non-financial report. 
The committee also discussed the work of the Bank’s Group Audit and Group Compliance units in detail. 
Both presented regular (at least quarterly) reports on the results of their work, measures to optimise it, the 
planning of their future activities, and presented their annual reports to the committee. In particular, the 
Audit Committee received regular reports on the results of various internal and external reviews of 
compliance with the local regulations that have to be observed by Commerzbank’s branches and subsidiaries 
worldwide. The committee also obtained an overview of the status of efforts to remedy any deficiencies 
identified in this area by means of regular (at least quarterly) reports from the business units concerned and 
from Group Audit and Group Compliance. The committee discussed the further development of know-your-
customer processes together with the Board of Managing Directors. In several meetings, the committee 
addressed in detail the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict on Commerzbank, especially with 
regard to compliance with internal and external requirements and sanctions. 
The committee reviewed the effectiveness of the Bank’s risk management system and of its internal 
control system in particular. This review was based on reports from a range of sources including the auditor, 
Group Risk Management and Group Audit. The committee also acknowledged the auditor’s report on the 
review of reporting obligations and rules of conduct under the German Securities Trading Act. The committee 
chairman met regularly, sometimes independently of the Board of Managing Directors, with the employees 
responsible for accounting, compliance and internal auditing. 
 
The Risk Committee held five ordinary meetings and one extraordinary meeting in the past financial year. 
At these meetings, it dealt intensively with the Bank’s risk situation and risk management, particularly against 
the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine war and the situation in the Middle East. In addition, the Risk Committee 
dealt extensively with cyber risks. Other important topics included the risks for Commerzbank arising from 
mBank’s Swiss franc loan portfolio and the approach to and management of country risks. Liquidity and

interest rate risks were examined against the backdrop of the crises at the US regional banks and the 
consolidation of the Swiss banking market. Developments in the real estate markets were monitored at the 
same time, and appropriate risk management was discussed. The Risk Committee also examined the overall 
risk strategy for 2023, the sub-risk strategies for 2023 and credit, market, liquidity, counterparty and 
operational risks. It also dealt with reputational, compliance and ESG risks, as well as regulatory risks. It 
discussed Commerzbank’s loan portfolio, loan loss provisions and risk result, as well as its capital ratios. 
Significant individual exposures of the Bank were also discussed in detail with the Board of Managing 
Directors, as were portfolios and sub-portfolios. The Risk Committee also considered major corporate 
transactions and the development of equity holdings. The committee was also briefed on the update to the 
recovery plan and the adjustment of recovery plan indicators. The Risk Committee additionally reviewed 
whether terms and conditions in customer business are compatible with the Bank’s business model and risk 
structure, and discussed various stress tests and their results. The meetings included consideration of the 
employee remuneration system, human resources risk and the audits and risk assessment of Commerzbank 
by its regulators. The Risk Committee also examined Commerzbank’s risk-bearing capacity, major loans to 
Commerzbank Group companies, loans to officers at those parties and high-risk exposures. 
 
The Presiding and Nomination Committee held six ordinary and two extraordinary meetings. The 
discussions of the Presiding and Nomination Committee were mainly devoted to preparing the plenary 
Supervisory Board meetings and in-depth treatment of the meeting deliberations, especially with regard to 
appointments to the Board of Managing Directors, matters relating to the Board of Managing Directors, and 
the composition of bodies. It dealt intensively with personnel issues, in particular with the search for a 
successor for Dr. Marcus Chromik, who left at the end of 2023, and this resulted in the appointment of 
Bernhard Spalt as the new Chief Risk Officer from 1 January 2024. In this context, the committee also examined 
and approved Bernhard Spalt’s individual suitability and the collective suitability of the Board of Managing 
Directors assuming his inclusion. It discussed the extension of Michael Kotzbauer’s appointment to the Board of 
Managing Directors and made its recommendation to the Supervisory Board. The committee discussed 
succession planning for the Board of Managing Directors in detail and decided to organise this in a more 
structured and long-term manner with the help of an external consultant. It approved requests for members of 
the Board of Managing Directors to take up board mandates with other companies and took note of changes to 
Commerzbank’s central advisory council. The Committee prepared the nomination of the shareholder 
representatives for election to the Supervisory Board by the 2023 Annual General Meeting and submitted 
corresponding resolution recommendations to the plenary Supervisory Board. In the 2023 financial year, the 
committee also discussed the results of the internal evaluation of the Board of Managing Directors and the 
Supervisory Board using questionnaires and the Supervisory Board’s self-assessment for the 2022 financial year. 
It approved the suitability matrix for the Supervisory Board and the Board of Managing Directors. Human 
resources issues were also discussed with the committee. In particular, the committee was presented with the 
principles for the selection and appointment of the first and second levels of management, which it deliberated. 
 
The Compensation Control Committee held five ordinary meetings. It assisted the Supervisory Board in 
setting the targets for the members of the Board of Managing Directors for the 2024 financial year and made 
corresponding recommendations for resolutions. The committee also considered the target achievement of 
the Board of Managing Directors for 2022 and reviewed the setting of the total amount of variable 
remuneration for employees in respect of 2022. It additionally considered the further development of the 
system of variable compensation for the Board of Managing Directors. The committee was also consulted on 
the extension of the appointment of the Remuneration Officer and discussed the compensation control report 
prepared by the Remuneration Officer. The Compensation Control Committee reviewed the performance 
evaluations of former members of the Board of Managing Directors with regard to the long-term incentive 
component of variable remuneration for past performance years by means of a retrospective assessment and 
submitted corresponding resolution recommendations to the plenary Supervisory Board.

The committee considered the audit of the remuneration report and recommended that the Supervisory 
Board engage the auditor KPMG to check the accuracy of the content of the remuneration report for the 
2023 reporting year under the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), in addition to ensuring that it meets 
the legal requirements set out in Art. 162 (3) AktG. The committee reviewed the appropriateness of the 
structure of the remuneration for the Board of Managing Directors with the support of an external 
remuneration consultant and examined the structure and appropriateness of the employee remuneration 
systems for Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft.  
In addition, the committee assessed the impact of the remuneration systems on the Bank’s risk, capital 
and liquidity situation and monitored whether the remuneration systems are aligned with the Bank’s 
business and risk strategy. The committee also reviewed the principles of the employee remuneration system 
used to measure remuneration parameters, performance contributions and performance and retention 
periods, and monitored the process used to identify institution risk bearers and Group risk bearers. Finally, 
the committee reviewed the remuneration system for the control units and monitored the involvement of the 
control units and all other relevant areas in the design of the employee remuneration system.  
 
The Environmental, Social and Governance Committee (ESG Committee) held four ordinary meetings 
in the reporting year. It addressed the sustainability strategy and management, the ESG framework and the 
status of regulatory requirements. The committee dealt with, among other things, biodiversity, the European 
Green Deal, the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG), 
environmental risk control and the EU taxonomy. In addition, it discussed interim targets under the Science 
Based Targets initiative and received a report on the current status of employee training on the ESG 
principles at Commerzbank. It considered the Bank’s sustainability reporting in detail as part of the 
preparation of Commerzbank’s combined separate non-financial report and its external disclosure of climate

Directors. Moreover, it dealt with strategic personnel planning, the recruitment campaign, the young talent 
campaign and the human resource indicators. The committee discussed the results of staff surveys that had

The Digital Transformation Committee assisted the Supervisory Board with its monitoring and advisory 
tasks relating to the Bank’s digital transformation and IT; it held four ordinary meetings in 2023. The 
committee received regular information on the current status of IT and on the overall technical performance 
and stability of the IT systems, as well as updates on key strategic initiatives. To this end, the committee 
informed itself about projects and processes relating to the Bank’s digital transformation, its budget 
management and transformation management, and the status of individual projects. Based on the Bank’s 
strategy, it discussed the IT strategy for 2024 to 2027. The committee also dealt with Commerzbank’s 
payment transaction offering and vendor management. It looked at the Bank’s IT architecture and IT 
landscape and at the current developments on the fintech market. Looking to the future, it dealt with topics 
such as the digital workplace, the digital euro and the AI strategy. The members of the committee also 
learned about user experience and user interface and visited Commerzbank’s UX/UI studios. 
 
There was no need for any meetings of the Conciliation Committee formed in accordance with the German 
Codetermination Act.

Conflicts of interest 
In accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code and Art. 3 (6) of the rules of procedure of the 
Supervisory Board, members of Commerzbank’s Supervisory Board are required to disclose conflicts of 
interest without delay to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or the Chairman’s deputy, who will in turn 
inform the Supervisory Board. In order to prevent a potential conflict of interest with her role as CFO of 
Uniper SE, Dr. Jutta A. Dönges did not take part in any discussions or resolutions regarding loans from 
Commerzbank to Uniper SE.  
Training and development measures 
The members of the Supervisory Board undertook the training and development measures required for their 
duties at their own initiative, with appropriate support from Commerzbank. Further training and development 
took place on a regular basis. Following the Supervisory Board elections, a two-day onboarding event was held 
for the newly elected members of the Supervisory Board, in which re-elected members could and did take part. 
In addition, the new Supervisory Board members were offered individually tailored internal training and 
induction measures. Divisions such as Group Risk and Group Finance also provided individual Supervisory 
Board members with in-depth insight into their activities and organisation. In the 2023 financial year, a 
comprehensive workshop on the topic of “The EU Taxonomy and Commerzbank’s progress in implementing it” 
was held for all members of the Supervisory Board. A training event on the topic of “Software development – 
from an idea to the product” was also held. The committee chairmen also took part in a workshop on strategic 
issues at Commerzbank. The members of the Risk Committee received further training on balance sheet 
modelling in a workshop. The members of the Environmental, Social and Governance Committee received 
further training on the subject of biodiversity in the course of a committee meeting. Finally, some members of 
the Supervisory Board attended external training courses on topics such as risk management in banks, 
accounting and annual financial statement analysis, overall bank management and sustainable finance. 
Evaluation and self-assessment 
In the 2023 financial year the Supervisory Board and its committees dealt with the results of the review of the 
effectiveness of their work carried out in the 2022 financial year in accordance with recommendation D.12 of 
the German Corporate Governance Code, combined with the assessment to be carried out in accordance with 
Art. 25d (11) nos. 3 and 4 of the German Banking Act (KWG). Both the Supervisory Board and the individual 
committees drew up a catalogue of measures based on the results and implemented these measures. For 
example, the topics of ESG and digitalisation were defined as focal points of the training measures for the 
Supervisory Board for 2023 and Supervisory Board members became more involved in the strategy process 
and in strategic issues. At the end of the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board reviewed the 
effectiveness of its work in the 2023 financial year with the support of an external consultancy and carried out 
the assessment required pursuant to Art. 25d (11) nos. 3 and 4 of the KWG. All members of the Supervisory 
Board and the Board of Managing Directors first completed questionnaires for this purpose. The consultants 
then conducted individual interviews with all members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Managing 
Directors based on an anonymous evaluation of these questionnaires. The resulting analyses were presented 
to and discussed with the Presiding and Nomination Committee and the plenary Supervisory Board at the 
beginning of the 2024 financial year. On the basis of these discussions, catalogues of measures were drawn 
up in turn in both plenary sessions and committee meetings, and these are being worked through in a timely 
manner. They include developing the strategic succession planning for the Board of Managing Directors and 
adjusting the skills and expertise profile of the Supervisory Board in a nuanced manner in line with the 
evaluation. The members of the Supervisory Board collectively believe that the board and its committees work 
effectively and to a high standard overall.

Supervisory Board in good time. The members of the Supervisory Board also had an opportunity to take part in 
a separate meeting with the auditor on the annual financial statements in advance of the Supervisory Board’s 
accounts review meeting. 
The Audit Committee dealt at length with the financial statements at its meeting on 12 March 2024. At 
the meeting on 13 March 2024, the Supervisory Board examined the parent company and Group financial 
statements of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, as well as the management reports of the parent company 
and the Group, in detail. Representatives of the auditor attended the above-mentioned meetings of the 
Audit Committee and the plenary Supervisory Board, where they explained the main findings of the audit 
and answered questions. The financial statements were discussed at length at both meetings. 
Following the final review by the Audit Committee and the plenary Supervisory Board, the Supervisory 
Board raised no objections to the parent company and Group financial statements and concurred with the 
findings of the auditors. The Supervisory Board approved the financial statements of the parent company 
and the Group prepared by the Board of Managing Directors; the financial statements of the parent 
company were thus adopted. The Supervisory Board concurs with the recommendation made by the Board 
of Managing Directors on the appropriation of profit. 
Non-financial report 
The ESG Committee reviewed in detail the combined separate non-financial report as at 31 December 2023 
for Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and the Group, as prepared by the Board of Managing Directors. The 
Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also discussed the report as well as the audit of the non-financial 
report carried out by KPMG. KPMG conducted an audit to obtain limited assurance and issued an unqualified 
report. Representatives of the auditor attended the meeting of the Audit Committee on 12 March 2024 and 
the meeting of the Supervisory Board on 13 March 2024, reported on the main results of their audit and 
answered supplementary questions from the members of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board 
raised no objections. 
Shareholder communications 
Communication with our shareholders takes place within the framework of the Annual General Meeting and 
via the Investor Relations department. As Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Commerzbank I engage in 
regular dialogue with key national and international shareholders and investors on topics such as corporate 
governance, the qualifications and composition of the Board of Managing Directors and Supervisory Board, 
the remuneration systems of the Board of Managing Directors and Supervisory Board, the role of the 
Supervisory Board in the strategy development and implementation process, digitalisation and sustainability. 
The presentations used for these discussions, together with the key messages, are published on the website 
of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and made available to other shareholders and interested outsiders.

On behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to thank all of the departed Supervisory Board 
members for their dedicated work and outstanding performance. Our special thanks go to Helmut Gottschalk 
for his great commitment and extraordinary efforts over the last two years as well as for his constructive and

expiry of his contract. He worked for the Bank for almost 15 years in various positions, most recently eight 
years as Chief Risk Officer, and showed extraordinary and comprehensive commitment to the Bank. I would 
like to sincerely thank Dr. Marcus Chromik on behalf of the entire Supervisory Board for his outstanding 
achievements and his great commitment to Commerzbank, and especially for his consistently trusting 
cooperation. We wish him all the best for the future. Bernhard Spalt has been a new member of the Board of

success in the varied responsibilities that await him. 
I would also like to thank the Board of Managing Directors and all our employees for their outstanding 
commitment and performance during the financial year. 
Finally, I would like to thank all members of the Supervisory Board for working well and constructively 
together, for their commitment and for the high degree of mutual trust on the board.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Development of equity markets and 
performance indices 
Despite 
the 
ongoing 
fraught 
geopolitical 
and 
economic 
environment, 2023 was a good year on stock markets for investors. 
The Russian invasion of Ukraine continued to have a negative 
impact on international trade relations. The escalating crisis in the 
Middle East and the smouldering Taiwan conflict also further 
exacerbated international uncertainty, impeding the general 
economic recovery.  
The initially substantial increase in prices for fossil fuels and 
food weakened in the period under review, but the average annual 
inflation rate remained comparably high at 5.9% and the markets 
benefited from investors channelling their money into equities, 
real estate and tangible assets in an effort to protect against high 
inflation. The European Central Bank responded with a total of six 
interest rate increases as it pursued its monetary policy remit. 
Long-term bond yields signal the expectation that inflation rates 
should ease. The yield on ten-year German Bunds fell from 2.50% 
at the end of 2022 to 2.02% at the end of 2023, reflecting an 
inverted yield curve compared to the significantly higher short-
term inflation concerns. 
However, the uptick in lending rates suppressed demand for 
credit both for companies and, in particular, on the real estate 
market. The number of building permits in Germany fell sharply in 
2023. Private consumption also proved unable to prop up the 
economy due to high consumer prices. The positive perception of 
falling inflation thanks to rising interest rates and a stronger euro 
had a positive effect on share prices. At the end of July 2023, the 
DAX reached a provisional all-time high at almost 16,529 points 
before nosediving over the rest of the summer into autumn due to 
persistent economic concerns, with the international stock 
markets following suit. Prices managed to recover from their lows 
over the remainder of 2023 and – driven by the expectation that 
central banks would lower their policy rates again given falling 
inflation – posted sizeable gains towards the end of the year. As a 
result, the DAX hit its annual high for the 2023 financial year on 
14 December at 17,003 points. 
The leading German share index, the DAX, recorded an 
increase of 20.3% in 2023, while the MDAX was up 8.0%. The 
leading European index, the EuroStoxx 50, gained 17.4%. 
The Commerzbank share 
At the start of 2023, the European banking sector was looking 
ahead with confidence, particularly given that the coronavirus 
pandemic had so far only a moderate impact on institutions’ 
business models. In light of rising expectations of further interest 
rate hikes and consequently higher earnings contributions, profit 
estimates for banks were gradually raised. It was amid this 
environment that Commerzbank shares reached their high for the 
year of €12.01 on 7 March. Just two days later, the difficulties 
encountered by US-based Silicon Valley Bank sent renewed 
ripples through the international financial markets. In the days 
that followed, Swiss bank Credit Suisse saw its long-standing crisis 
go from bad to worse and was subsequently taken over by UBS on 
19 March 2023. Both events triggered major losses on the 
international stock markets. Bank share prices collapsed, and the 
Commerzbank share price hit its low for the year of €8.31 on 
20 March 2023. 
Both the American and Swiss supervisory authorities took 
quick and decisive action to prevent contagion to other markets 
and regain the confidence of market participants, prompting a 
renewed uptick in bank share prices. 
In response to the continued high rates of inflation, the 
European Central Bank raised policy rates in six more steps in 
2023. Since 20 September 2023, the last increase in the period 
under review, the deposit facility rate has been 4.00%. This is a 
significant increase compared with the rate of 1.25% at the end of 
the previous year and has paved the way for significantly improved 
net interest income on the part of European banks. These interest 
rate increases also enabled European bank share prices to rally 
strongly during the second half of 2023 compared with their lows 
for the year. Consequently, the European sector index EuroStoxx 
Banks closed the year with a major gain of 23.5%. 
With a gain of 21.8%, the Commerzbank share price also 
performed exceptionally well in 2023.  
On 8 November, Commerzbank announced its capital market 
update 
with 
a 
strategic 
plan 
through 
2027. 
With 
the 
comprehensive cost and restructuring programme containing 
targets for 2024 that have already largely been achieved in 2023, 
the focus of the new plan going forward is on further growth in the 
operating segments.

Commerzbank shares were trading at €10.76 at year-end. This put 
Commerzbank’s market capitalisation at €13.3bn (maximum 
€14.9bn, minimum €10.3bn), compared with €11.1bn in the 
previous year. The price-to-book ratio ranged between 0.41 and 
0.56 during the year under review. By way of comparison, the 
figure for the European banking index ranged between 0.52 and 
0.77. The average daily turnover of Commerzbank shares – i.e. the 
number of shares traded – was 7.5 million, slightly above the 
previous year’s figure of 7.4 million. 
Commerzbank share – key figures 
With a lower number of shares following the successful share 
buyback in 2023, the earnings per share in the 2023 financial year 
was €1.63. This was mainly due to a significant year-on-year 
improvement in net profit, which benefited in particular from a 
significant rise in income, substantially lower risk provisioning and 
reduced compulsory contributions.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Shareholder structure and analyst 
recommendations 
As at 31 December 2023, around 40% of Commerzbank shares 
were held by the Federal Republic of Germany and our mostly 
German-based private shareholders. Consequently, as at end-2023 
around 60% of all Commerzbank shares were held by institutional 
investors, including in particular BlackRock with just over 8% and 
the Norwegian state, which holds a stake of around 3% via 
Norges Bank. The free float stood at around 84%. 
 
 
 
Some 25 analysts provided regular coverage of Commerzbank 
during 2023. At the end of 2023, the proportion of buy 
recommendations was 68%, compared with 56% in the previous 
year. A further 24% of analysts recommended a hold, while two 
analysts recommended selling our shares, compared with none in 
the previous year. The analysts’ average price target at the end of 
the year was €14.60, versus €10.43 at the end of the previous 
year. 
Commerzbank’s ratings 
The rating agencies assess Commerzbank as a bank with a strong 
customer business and a leading market position in German 
corporate customer business. The asset quality in the loan 
portfolio is viewed as robust, but the risks in the Corporate Clients 
portfolio could be susceptible to volatility given prevailing 
geopolitical tensions and the cautious economic outlook in 
Germany. The liquidity situation is rated as solid. The refinancing 
options through deposits and Pfandbriefe are stable and show a 
moderate dependence on the capital market. The Bank’s 
capitalisation is deemed to be solid. The capital buffers currently 
in place help both in the transformation process and in the event 
of unforeseen risks, and can be used to absorb losses to protect 
senior creditors.  
The rating agencies are aware of the fact that the Bank has 
already achieved important milestones in the transformation and 
realignment of its business model. Worthy of particular note here 
is the significant improvement in profitability, which provides the 
basis for further structural improvements to profitability as part of 
the “Strategy 2027” programme. 
Rating events in 2023 
 
S&P Global Ratings   issuer rating = “A–” 
In March 2023, S&P raised Commerzbank’s deposit/issuer credit 
rating (Preferred Senior Rating) by one notch to “A–” with a stable 
outlook. At the same time, the counterparty rating (Resolution 
Counterparty Rating) was increased by one level to “A”. The rating 
measure was driven by a strong loss-absorbing buffer that 
provides further protection to senior creditors in a hypothetical 
resolution scenario. At 6.5% in 2022, the additional loss-
absorbing capacity (ALAC) exceeded the theoretically relevant 
threshold for the S&P model of 6%. This results in an increase in 
support by two levels (previously one level) to the stand-alone 
rating “bbb”. S&P assumes that Commerzbank will be able to 
maintain or exceed the threshold of 6% in the coming years. 
In November 2023, S&P raised the issuer rating outlook to 
positive, recognising that the Bank had achieved important 
milestones in its transformation and realignment of the business 
model and had also improved its profitability. 
 
Moody’s Investors Service   issuer rating = “A2” 
The long-term issuer rating, also known as the Preferred Senior 
Unsecured Debt Rating, remained unchanged at “A2” with a stable 
outlook in the 2023 financial year. The volume of bail-in-eligible 
instruments as a percentage of total assets, which feeds into 
Moody’s proprietary loss-given-failure (LGF) model, provided two 
notches of rating support compared to the stand-alone rating of 
“baa2”. An additional notch was also given for possible state 
support in the event of insolvency. The ratings for Commerzbank 
mortgage 
Pfandbriefe 
and 
public-sector 
Pfandbriefe 
were 
unchanged at “AAA”.

In addition to the statutory requirements pursuant to Art. 315d in 
conjunction with Art. 289f of the German Commercial Code (HGB), 
the Board of Managing Directors and Supervisory Board must 
report on the Bank’s corporate governance in the declaration on 
corporate governance. This follows from Principle 23 of the 
German Corporate Governance Code in the version of 28 April 
2022, published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) on 
27 June 2022, on which this declaration is based.  
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft attaches great importance to 
responsible and transparent corporate governance aimed at 
sustainable value creation. That is why the Board of Managing 
Directors and the Supervisory Board expressly support the goals 
and objectives set out in the German Corporate Governance Code. 
Recommendations of the German Corporate 
Governance Code 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and its subsidiaries that are 
required by law to do so declare every year whether the 
recommendations of the Government Commission on the German 
Corporate Governance Code have been and are being complied 
with and explain why individual recommendations are not being 
implemented. These annual declarations of compliance by the 
Board of Managing Directors and Supervisory Board are published 
on the websites of the individual companies. Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft’s 
declarations 
can 
be 
found 
at 
https://investorrelations.commerzbank.com/de/entsprechenserklae
rung. There is also an archive of all the declarations of compliance 
made since 2002. The declaration valid as of 31 December 2023 
was made in November 2023. 
As can be seen from the wording of the declaration below, 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft complies with virtually all of the 
recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code; it 
deviates from them in only a few points: 
 
Since the submission of the last Declaration of Compliance in 
December 2022, the recommendations of the “German Corporate 
Governance Code Commission” in the version of 28 April 2022  
– published in the Bundesanzeiger (Federal Gazette) on 27 June 
2022 – have been complied with, except for the following 
recommendations:  
 
• According to Recommendation G.10 Sentence 2 of the Code 
the granted long-term variable remuneration components shall 
be accessible to a member of the Board of Managing Directors 
only after a period of four years. The remuneration system for 
members of the Board of Managing Directors, in force since 
1 January 2023, deviates from the recommendation, as the 
member of the Board of Managing Directors can access to a 
part of the granted long-term variable remuneration (LTI) 
before the end of the four-year period. The remuneration 
system provides that beginning with the LTI for the financial 
year 2023, subject to the regular deferral period of five years, 
the LTI is payable in five tranches, each tranche equally split 
into a cash and a share-based payment. In addition, the share-
based payment of the LTI is subject to a twelve-month retention 
period. Therefore, the member of the Board of Managing 
Directors receives 50% of the LTI already before the end of the 
four-year period. The details are illustrated in the remuneration 
system for the Board of Managing Directors, which is 
published on the homepage. The payment of the LTI in 
tranches is consistent with the bank-specific regulatory 
requirements set out in the Remuneration Ordinance for 
Institutions 
(Institutsvergütungsverordnung). 
A 
further 
tightening of these bank-specific requirements is neither 
necessary 
nor 
appropriate. 
Concurrently, 
through 
this 
systematics a closer link is achieved between the payout of the 
LTIs and the success of the financial year, for which the LTI-
components are paid. Thereby, the members of the Board of 
Managing Directors are more directly incentivised.  
 
• However, the Recommendation G.10 Sentence 1 of the Code has 
been complied with since the introduction of the new 
remuneration system for the Board of Managing Directors as of 
1 January 2023. From this point in time and in accordance with 
the recommendation, the variable remuneration to the member 
of the Board of Managing Directors is – taking into consideration 
the respective tax burden – predominantly invested in company 
shares or granted as share-based remuneration.  
Suggestions of the German Corporate 
Governance Code 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft complies with all of the 
suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Code recommendations not applicable because 
of overriding statutory provisions 
The German Corporate Governance Code has restricted the 
applicability of its recommendations to banks and insurance 
companies in that they apply to them only to the extent that the 
recommendations do not conflict with statutory provisions. In 
accordance with recommendation F.4 of the Code, these statutory 
provisions and the effects on the declaration of compliance are to 
be disclosed in the declaration on corporate governance in the 
Annual Report. 
At 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft 
this 
applies 
to 
recommendation D.4 of the Code, according to which the 
Supervisory Board should establish a Nomination Committee 
made up exclusively of shareholder representatives. According to 
the 
prevailing 
view, 
a 
general 
exclusion 
of 
employee 
representatives on the Supervisory Board from membership of a 
committee is only permissible if there is an objective reason for 
doing so. Such an objective reason could exist if a committee were 
to deal exclusively with matters relating only to the shareholder 
representatives on the Supervisory Board, for example if the sole 
task of the Nomination Committee were to prepare proposals for 
the election of shareholder representatives to be put to the Annual 
General Meeting. Under Art. 25d (11) of the German Banking Act 
(KWG), however, the nomination committee of a bank is also 
assigned other tasks, including tasks for which the involvement of 
employee representatives is customary and necessary. For 
example, the nomination committee is tasked with assisting the 
respective company’s supervisory board in identifying candidates 
to fill management positions, and in the regular assessment of the 
management board and the supervisory board. The involvement of 
employee representatives in these tasks is established practice at 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. Nonetheless, in order to comply 
with recommendation D.4 of the Code as far as possible, the rules 
of procedure of the Presiding and Nomination Committee of the 
Supervisory Board stipulate that the election proposals to be put to 
the Annual General Meeting be prepared only by the shareholder 
representatives on the committee. 
Company values and governance practices of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and the 
Commerzbank Group 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
are 
committed 
to 
their 
corporate, 
environmental 
and 
social 
responsibilities. To ensure sustainable corporate governance, 
extensive standards were defined in various spheres of activity and 
published on Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s website. 
The 
corporate 
values 
of 
integrity, 
performance 
and 
responsibility create the basis for the corporate culture. They 
shape both the way employees interact with each other and their 
behaviour towards customers, business partners and other 
stakeholders. These values take high priority at Commerzbank and 
show that Commerzbank is aware of its corporate responsibility.  
Based 
on 
its 
corporate 
values, 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft has set out codes of conduct for acting with 
integrity, which provide all Commerzbank Group employees with a 
binding framework for lawful and ethically appropriate conduct in 
the day-to-day working environment. The codes of conduct are 
reviewed on a regular basis and revised if required; they were 
most recently revised in the 2023 financial year.  
In its environmental, social and governance (ESG) framework, 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft sets out all the key components 
of its sustainability strategy and makes sustainability a central 
management parameter. In this way, the Bank provides its 
stakeholders with the greatest possible transparency regarding its 
understanding of sustainability. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft 
has thereby created a Bank-wide standard that enables stringent 
management of all relevant products, processes and activities and 
ensures the sustainable transformation of Commerzbank. 
The ESG framework also defines positions and policies on 
environmental and social issues. These are applied to the 
evaluation of transactions and business relationships and thus act 
as important points of reference. The basis for their preparation 
and regular review is the ongoing monitoring of media and non-
governmental 
organisations 
(NGOs) 
on 
controversial 
environmental or social issues and regular discussion with NGOs. 
In addition, specific environmental guidelines have been 
formulated to guide the management of operational environmental 
impacts. 
Board of Managing Directors 
The 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft 
Board 
of 
Managing 
Directors is responsible for independently managing the Bank in 
the Bank’s best interest. In doing so, it must consider the interests 
of shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders, 
with the objective of sustainable value creation. It develops the 
Bank’s strategic direction, discusses it with the Supervisory Board 
and ensures its implementation. In addition, it sees that efficient 
risk management and risk control measures are in place. The 
Board of Managing Directors simultaneously manages the 
Commerzbank Group as the Group executive body on the basis of 
uniform guidelines and exercises general control over all Group 
companies.

It conducts the Bank’s business activities in accordance with

employee 
representatives and the corporate bodies of other Group 
companies. 
The composition of the Board of Managing Directors and the 
responsibilities of its individual members are presented on page 5

is published on Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s website. 
Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft 
advises and monitors the Board of Managing Directors in its 
management of the Bank and is directly involved in decisions of 
fundamental importance. The Supervisory Board discharges its 
responsibilities in accordance with legal requirements, the Articles 
of Association and its rules of procedure. It cooperates closely and 
on a basis of trust with the Board of Managing Directors in the 
interests of the Bank. Taking into account the recommendations of 
the Presiding and Nomination Committee, the Supervisory Board 
decides on the appointment and dismissal of members of the 
Board of Managing Directors and, together with the Board of 
Managing Directors, ensures long-term succession planning. If 
necessary, external consultants are brought in. 
The composition of the Supervisory Board and the members of 
its committees are presented on pages 17 to 19 of this Annual 
Report, in accordance with recommendation D.2 of the German 
Corporate Governance Code. Details of the work of this body, its 
structure and its control function can be found in the report of the 
Supervisory Board on pages 6 to 16. Further details on how the 
Supervisory Board and its committees work can be found in the 
rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board, available on 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s website. The duties of the 
individual committees are set out in the respective rules of 
procedure, which can also be viewed on the Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft website. 
According to recommendation C.1 of the Code, the Supervisory 
Board should set concrete objectives and draw up a profile of skills 
and expertise for the board as a whole. In doing so, it should give 
consideration to diversity. The profile of skills of the Supervisory 
Board is also to include expertise with respect to the sustainability 
issues of importance to the Bank. Appointments proposed by the 
Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting should take 
these objectives into account while also seeking to fulfil the profile 
of skills and expertise for the board as a whole. The status of 
implementation is to be disclosed in the form of a qualification 
matrix in the declaration on corporate governance. In addition, in 
accordance with recommendation C.2 of the Code, an age limit for 
members of the Supervisory Board should be specified and 
disclosed in the declaration on corporate governance. The length 
of Supervisory Board membership is also to be disclosed in 
accordance with recommendation C.3 of the Code.  
The Supervisory Board of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft has 
approved the following concrete objectives: 
The composition of the Supervisory Board should be such that, 
overall, its members have the necessary skills, expertise, 
experience and knowledge to be able to perform its duties 
properly. In particular, the Supervisory Board should have all the 
expertise and experience deemed essential for the activities of the 
Commerzbank Group. In addition, the legal requirements with 
regard to special expertise and professional experience of 
individual members of the Supervisory Board in specific areas 
must be met (for example, expertise in the areas of accounting 
and auditing, including sustainability reporting and auditing 
thereof, as well as in the areas of risk management and risk 
controlling), and at least one member of the Supervisory Board 
should have special expertise in Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) issues. The members of the Supervisory Board 
must be able to challenge and monitor the decisions made by the 
Board of Managing Directors. The members of the Supervisory 
Board should also be able to devote sufficient time to the 
performance of their duties. Members should be reliable, and 
consideration should be given to their commitment, personality, 
professionalism, integrity and independence. The target is that the 
Supervisory Board should always have at least eight members 
elected by the Annual General Meeting who are independent as 
defined in recommendation C.6 of the Code, and not more than 
two former members of the Board of Managing Directors of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. The length of service of the 
Supervisory Board members elected by the Annual General 
Meeting should generally not exceed a period of 12 years. The 
term of office of a member of the Supervisory Board should 
generally end at the end of the Annual General Meeting following 
the member’s 72nd birthday. 
The Supervisory Board has resolved a detailed profile of skills 
and expertise for its composition, which may be consulted on 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s website.  
As can be seen from the following qualification matrix based on 
a self-assessment by members of the Supervisory Board, all 
objectives set by the Supervisory Board with regard to its 
composition, as well as its profile of skills, had been implemented 
as of 31 December 2023:

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Burkhard Keese, Chairman of the Audit Committee, has particular 
expertise in the areas of both accounting and auditing. As Chief 
Financial Officer of Lloyd’s of London and a former partner and 
auditor at KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, he has 
extensive experience in the areas of finance and auditing, giving 
him special expertise in the areas of both accounting and auditing. 
Frank Westhoff, another member of the Audit Committee and a 
former Chief Risk Officer at DZ Bank AG, has special expertise in the 
field of accounting and can also leverage knowledge from the area 
of auditing. Other members of the Audit Committee are also highly 
proficient in the fields of accounting and auditing. This includes 
Dr. Frank Czichowski, who acquired this knowledge mainly through 
his previous role as Treasurer of the KfW Banking Group.  
Under Art. 25d (12) KWG at least one member of the 
Compensation Control Committee must have sufficient expertise 
and professional experience in risk management and risk 
controlling, particularly with respect to mechanisms for gearing 
remuneration systems to the Bank’s overall risk disposition and 
strategy and to its capital resources. Frank Westhoff, as a former 
Chief Risk Officer at DZ Bank AG and current Chairman of the Risk 
Committee of Commerzbank’s Supervisory Board, meets these 
requirements.  
In order to remain aligned with developments within 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft in matters of sustainability and 
also to ensure that the growing requirements and responsibilities 
of the Supervisory Board in this area are properly met, the 
Supervisory Board has formed an Environmental, Social and 
Governance Committee (ESG Committee) that deals in depth with 
these issues. In addition, Dr. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Maxi 
Leuchters and Dr. Frank Czichowski as well as other members of 
the Supervisory Board have special expertise in the field of ESG. 
During her many years working for central banks, Dr. Gertrude 
Tumpel-Gugerell has gained in-depth knowledge of social and 
governance issues at financial institutions. As Head of Department 
at Hans-Böckler-Stiftung and a member of the European Economic 
and Social Committee, Maxi Leuchters is keenly acquainted with 
current sustainable finance and corporate governance topics. 
Dr. Frank Czichowski has extensive expertise in the area of 
sustainable investments and the management of financial 
institutions. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board and especially the 
Risk Committee are increasingly dealing with cyber risks as part of 
their control and monitoring activities. Given the ongoing and in-
depth discussion of this issue on the Risk Committee, the members 
of the committee in particular have special expertise in this area. 
For further information on the individual members of the 
Supervisory Board, please refer to their curricula vitae, which are 
available on the Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft website.  
In accordance with recommendation C.1 of the Code, the 
declaration on corporate governance should also provide 
information 
on 
what, 
in 
the 
view 
of 
the 
shareholder 
representatives, is the appropriate number of independent 
shareholder representatives serving on the Supervisory Board and 
the names of these members. According to recommendation C.6 of 
the Code, a Supervisory Board member is considered as 
independent if he or she is independent of the Bank and its Board 
of Managing Directors and independent of any controlling 
shareholder. Recommendation C.7 of the Code stipulates that a 
Supervisory Board member is independent of the Bank and its 
Board of Managing Directors if he or she has no personal or 
business relationship with the Bank or its Board of Managing 
Directors that may lead to a significant, non-transient conflict of 
interest. When assessing the independence of their members 
according to recommendation C.7 of the Code, the shareholder 
representatives should in particular take into account whether the 
Supervisory Board member him- or herself or a close relative of 
the Supervisory Board member was a member of the Bank’s Board 
of Managing Directors in the two years before his or her 
appointment. It should also be taken into account whether the 
Supervisory Board member currently has or had in the year 
leading up to his or her appointment a material business 
relationship with the Bank or one of its dependent companies, 
either directly or as a shareholder or in a responsible function of a 
non-Group company, is a close relative of a member of the Board 
of Managing Directors, or has been a member of the Supervisory 
Board for more than 12 years. With regard to a possible 
controlling shareholder, recommendation C.9 of the Code 
stipulates that a Supervisory Board member is considered 
independent of a controlling shareholder if he or she or a close 
relative is neither a controlling shareholder nor a member of the 
controlling shareholder’s governing body, and does not have a 
personal or business relationship with the controlling shareholder 
that may give rise to a significant, non-transient conflict of 
interest. A shareholder is deemed to be a controlling shareholder 
if a control agreement has been concluded with him or her or he 
or she holds the majority of voting rights. Finally, in accordance 
with recommendation C.11 of the Code, the Supervisory Board 
should not include more than two former members of the Board of 
Managing Directors of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. 
Based on the above criteria, all ten shareholder representatives 
can be classified as “independent” within the meaning of the 
German Corporate Governance Code, namely Prof. Dr. Jens 
Weidmann, Dr. Frank Czichowski, Sabine U. Dietrich, Dr. Jutta A. 
Dönges, Burkhard Keese, Daniela Mattheus, Caroline Seifert, 
Harald Christ, Dr. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell and Frank Westhoff. 
Dr. Jutta A. Dönges and Harald Christ were proposed for election 
to the Supervisory Board of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft at 
the suggestion of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund, 
represented by the Federal Republic of Germany – Finanzagentur 
GmbH. The Financial Market Stabilisation Fund holds around 
15.75% of the share capital of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft 
and is therefore already not a controlling shareholder within the 
meaning of the Code. Nor does the Federal Republic of Germany – 
Finanzagentur GmbH have a material business relationship with 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. In addition, there is no former

member of the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft on the Supervisory Board. 
As a result, the target of always having at least eight 
independent Supervisory Board members elected by the Annual 
General Meeting has been achieved. The Supervisory Board’s own 
assessment that it contains an appropriate number of independent 
members is therefore well-founded.  
In the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board and its 
committees addressed the results of the review of the effectiveness 
of their work carried out in the 2022 financial year in accordance 
with recommendation D.12 of the Code, combined with the 
assessment to be carried out by the Board of Managing Directors 
and Supervisory Board pursuant to Art. 25d (11) nos. 3 and 4 
KWG. Both the Supervisory Board and the individual committees 
drew up a catalogue of measures based on the results and 
implemented these measures; in the case of the Supervisory 
Board, these related to matters including qualification and 
ongoing training of Supervisory Board members, especially in the 
areas of ESG and digitalisation, and efficient communication 
between the Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory 
Board. At the end of the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory 
Board, 
supported 
by 
an 
external 
advisor, 
reviewed 
the 
effectiveness of its work in the 2023 financial year, and together 
with this external advisor carried out the assessment required 
pursuant to Art. 25d (11) nos. 3 and 4 KWG. For this purpose, all 
members of the Supervisory Board and members of the Board of 
Managing Directors started off by completing questionnaires, 
which were subsequently analysed. In a second step, an interview 
was conducted on the basis of this analysis with each member of 
the Supervisory Board and member of the Board of Managing 
Directors. The responses from the questionnaires and interviews 
were analysed in detail, and the results then presented to the 
Supervisory Board at the beginning of the 2024 financial year and 
discussed in plenary session. On the basis of these discussions, 
catalogues of measures were drawn up both by the Supervisory 
Board and in the committees, and these are being worked through 
in a timely manner. The members of the Supervisory Board are of 
the overall opinion that the Supervisory Board and its committees 
work effectively and to a high standard.  
In accordance with recommendation E.2 of the Code and Art. 3 
(6) of the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board, each member 
of the Supervisory Board must disclose any conflicts of interest. In 
order to prevent a potential conflict of interest with her role as CFO 
of Uniper SE, Dr. Jutta A. Dönges did not take part in any 
discussions or resolutions regarding loans from Commerzbank to 
Uniper SE. 
In accordance with recommendation B.2 of the Code, the 
Supervisory Board works with the Board of Managing Directors to 
ensure long-term succession planning for the Board of Managing 
Directors. This also includes measures to ensure they can respond 
appropriately to any short-term staffing changes, such as 
resignations for personal reasons. The Presiding and Nomination 
Committee of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s Supervisory Board 
is responsible for succession planning. It assists the Supervisory 
Board in selecting applicants for positions on the Board of 
Managing Directors. Therefore, it takes account of the balance and 
range of knowledge, skills and experience of all the board members 
and draws up a job description with an applicant profile. In drawing 
up the job description, it takes account of the skills profile and 
suitability matrix for the Board of Managing Directors as well as 
other targets for its composition, such as diversity. In accordance 
with Art. 25d (11) no. 5 KWG, the Presiding and Nomination 
Committee also reviews the principles of the Board of Managing 
Directors for the selection and appointment of persons at top 
management level. Together with the Chairman of the Board, it 
regularly 
discusses 
potentially 
suitable 
internal 
succession 
candidates for appointment to the Board of Managing Directors. In 
order to make succession planning even more structured and gear it 
to the longer term, the process is currently under further 
development with the support of an external consultant.  
The system for the remuneration of Supervisory Board 
members adopted by the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2022 
and 
applicable 
since 
1 January 
2022 
is 
contained 
in 
Commerzbank’s Articles of Association and published together 
with the resolution on Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s website. 
The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board is also 
presented in detail in the remuneration report, which is published 
on Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s website. 
Diversity 
Both Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and the Group companies 
take diversity into account in the composition of the Board of 
Managing 
Directors, 
appointments 
to 
management 
and 
recommendations for the election of Supervisory Board members, 
in line with recommendations A.2, B.1 and C.1 of the Code. The 
aim is to reduce the risk of prejudice and “groupthink”. In 
addition, diversity contributes to a broader range of experience 
and a greater spectrum of knowledge, capabilities and expertise. 
Diversity policy and information on the minimum 
proportions of women and men on the Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft 
consists of 20 members. As already mentioned in the description 
of the targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board on 
page 27, the Supervisory Board is supposed to always have at least 
eight members (shareholder representatives) elected by the 
Annual General Meeting who are independent as defined in 
recommendations C.6, C.7 and C.8 of the Code. In accordance 
with recommendation C.2 of the Code, the Supervisory Board has 
also defined an age limit for Supervisory Board members by 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
34 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
setting a standard limit of 72 years of age on the relevant 
reference date, that being the end of the Annual General Meeting. 
The Supervisory Board aims to have a broad range of ages 
represented on the board. In addition, the Supervisory Board 
ensures a suitable range of educational and professional 
backgrounds among the members of the Supervisory Board, and 
that the Supervisory board has at least one international member 
at all times. The Supervisory Board also considers appropriate 
female and male representation when proposing candidates to the 
Annual General Meeting for election. The Supervisory Board is 
committed to exceeding the statutory minimum requirement for 
female and male representation of at least 30% each. It must be 
borne in mind that the only way the Supervisory Board is able to 
influence its composition is by the candidates it proposes to the 
Annual 
General 
Meeting 
for 
election. 
The 
employee 
representatives on the Supervisory Board are also striving to 
exceed female and male representation of at least 30% each 
among employee representatives in future. 
The Supervisory Board achieved all the stated goals in the 2023 
financial year. As at 31 December 2023, the Supervisory Board of 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft 
included 
an 
international 
representative in the person of Dr. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell and, 
with Dr. Tumpel-Gugerell and Burkhard Keese in particular, two 
representatives with special international experience and/or 
expertise. Dr. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell is an Austrian citizen and 
has extensive experience and knowledge of Europe’s economy and 
financial institutions; for many years she was a member of the 
internationally staffed Executive Board of the European Central 
Bank. Burkhard Keese has worked at international financial 
services companies for many years, most notably at Lloyd’s of 
London in the United Kingdom since 2019. A total of 12 members 
of the Supervisory Board boast international experience and/or 
expertise. The Supervisory Board is made up of ten women and ten 
men. The genders are also equally represented on the shareholder 
and employee sides, each side having five women and five men. 
Where required by law, the Group companies have also set 
their own targets for the proportion of women on their supervisory 
boards.  
The members of the Supervisory Board of Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft were between 29 and 71 years old at the end of 
the reporting year; the average age was 53.6 years. The 
educational and professional backgrounds of the Supervisory 
Board members are varied: there are members of the Supervisory 
Board with banking training, lawyers, members with business 
degrees, and engineers. Many members of the Supervisory Board 
have significant banking experience. 
Diversity policy and minimum proportions on the Board 
of Managing Directors 
In making appointments to the Board of Managing Directors, the 
Supervisory Board aims to increase diversity, particularly with 
regard to age, origin, education and professional background, and 
to give appropriate consideration to women. As a rule, the 
members of the Board of Managing Directors should not be over 
65 years of age. In addition, the Supervisory Board ensures that 
the members of the Board of Managing Directors have a suitable 
range of educational and professional backgrounds. 
The Board of Managing Directors currently consists of seven 
members: two women and five men. This means that the minimum 
proportions under Art. 76 (3a) of the German Stock Corporation 
Act (AktG) have been met and indeed exceeded, according to 
which a Board of Managing Directors consisting of more than 
three people must have at least one woman and at least one man 
among its members. The Supervisory Board will strive to continue 
to exceed the statutory minimum proportions in the future. The 
proportion of women on the Board of Managing Directors was 
28.6% as at 31 December 2023. 
Where required by law, the Group companies have also set 
their own targets for the proportion of women on their 
management boards.  
Targets for the first and second levels of management 
Art. 76 (4) AktG requires the Board of Managing Directors of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft to set a target for female 
representation at the two management levels below the Board of 
Managing Directors and a deadline for achieving this target.  
The Board of Managing Directors last set new targets for 
female representation at the first and second levels of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s management (in Germany) in 
December 2021. The target is 25% for the first management level 
and likewise 25% for the second level. The deadline set for 
achieving the targets is 31 December 2026. Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft has thus given itself ambitious targets. It is an 
important objective for the Bank and the Group as a whole to 
further increase the number of women in management positions. 
As at 31 December 2023, the first management level below the 
Board of Managing Directors at Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft 
consisted of 41 managers, of whom 33 were male and 8 females. 
The percentage of women in the first level of management below 
the Board of Managing Directors was therefore 19.5%. 
The second management level below the Board of Managing 
Directors consisted of 306 people, of whom 236 were male and 
70 females. The percentage of women in the second level of 
management below the Board of Managing Directors was thus 
22.9%. 
The Board of Managing Directors chose not to set targets for 
the first and second levels of management at Group level. Instead, 
the individual Group companies have set their own targets within 
the statutory framework. 
In the Group, the first management level below the Board of 
Managing Directors consisted of 44 people, of whom 36 were 
male and 8 females. The percentage of women at the first level of

Accounting 
Accounting at the Commerzbank Group and Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft gives a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and financial performance of the Group in 
compliance with the respective accounting standards. The Group 
financial statements and Group management report are prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as published by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) and applicable in the EU (IFRS) and the supplementary 
provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB); the parent 
company 
financial 
statements 
and 
management 
report 
of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft are prepared in accordance with 
the provisions of the German Commercial Code. The Group financial 
statements and parent company financial statements are prepared 
by the Board of Managing Directors and approved by the 
Supervisory Board. The financial statements are thus adopted. The 
audit is performed by the auditor elected by the Annual General 
Meeting. 
The Group management report also includes a detailed risk 
report, providing information on the Bank’s responsible handling 
of the various types of risk. It may be found on pages 216 to 263 of 
this Annual Report. 
During the financial year, shareholders and third parties 
receive additional information about the course of business by 
means of the interim report as at 30 June and interim financial 
information as at 31 March and 30 September of a given year. The 
interim report as at 30 June is also prepared in accordance with 
IFRS. In the interim financial information as at 31 March and 
30 September, the statement of comprehensive income, balance 
sheet and statement of changes in equity are prepared in 
accordance with the applicable IFRS accounting, measurement 
and consolidation principles for interim reporting.  
Shareholder relations, transparency and 
communication 
The Annual General Meeting of shareholders takes place once a 
year. It decides on the appropriation of distributable profit (if any) 
and approves the actions of the Board of Managing Directors and 
the Supervisory Board, the appointment of the auditors and any 
amendments to the Articles of Association. 
If necessary, it authorises the Board of Managing Directors to 
undertake capital-raising measures and approves the conclusion of 
profit and loss transfer agreements. Each share entitles the holder 
to one vote. 
The Supervisory Board submitted a remuneration system for the 
members of the Board of Managing Directors to the 2022 Annual 
General Meeting for approval in accordance with Art. 120a (1) 
AktG. This proposed system had been enhanced in fundamental 
respects. The Annual General Meeting approved the remuneration 
system with 84.6% of votes in favour. The current remuneration 
system and the resolution of the Annual General Meeting are 
published on Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s website.  
The Bank’s shareholders may submit recommendations or 
other statements by letter or e-mail or may present them in 
person. Since the 2020 financial year, there has also been an 
orderly process regulated in the Engagement Policy for contacting 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft as a shareholder. At the Annual 
General Meeting, the Board of Managing Directors or the 
Supervisory Board comment or reply directly. Shareholders may 
codetermine the course of the Annual General Meeting by 
submitting countermotions or supplementary motions to the 
agenda. Shareholders may also request an Extraordinary General 
Meeting be convened. The reports and documents required by law 
for the Annual General Meeting, including the Annual Report, as 
well as the agenda for the Annual General Meeting and any 
countermotions or supplementary motions may be downloaded 
from the internet. 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft informs the public – and 
consequently shareholders as well – about the Bank’s financial 
position and financial performance four times a year. Corporate 
news that may affect the share price is also published in the form 
of ad hoc releases. This ensures that all shareholders are treated 
equally. The Board of Managing Directors reports on the annual 
financial statements and the quarterly results, as well as on the 
Bank’s future strategy, at press conferences and events for 
analysts and investors.  
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft uses the options offered by 
the internet for reporting purposes, providing a wealth of 
information about the Group at https://www.commerzbank.com. In 
addition to the rules of procedure of the Board of Managing 
Directors and the Supervisory Board, the Articles of Association of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft are also available online. The 
financial calendar for the current and the upcoming year is also 
published in the Annual Report and on the internet. It shows the 
dates of all the significant financial communications, notably the 
annual press conference and analyst conferences and the date of 
the Annual General Meeting. 
We feel an obligation to communicate openly and transparently 
with our shareholders and all other stakeholders. We intend to 
continue meeting this obligation in the future.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Information under takeover law required 
pursuant to Art. 315a of the German Commercial 
Code (HGB) and explanatory report 
Share capital structure 
The share capital of Commerzbank totalled €1,240,223,329.00 at 
the end of the financial year. It is divided into 1,240,223,329 no-
par-value shares. The shares are issued in bearer form. 
Commerzbank has issued only ordinary shares with the same 
rights and obligations. Each share has one vote. 
Restrictions on voting rights and transfers; nature of 
voting control for employee shares 
We are not aware of any restrictions on voting rights or the 
transfer of shares. In general, the voting right in cases under Art. 
136 of the German Stock Corporation Act is suspended by law for 
the shares concerned. Pursuant to Art. 71b of the German Stock 
Corporation Act, rights may also not be exercised for treasury 
shares. 
Employees who hold Commerzbank shares exercise their rights 
of control like any other shareholders, in accordance with the law 
and the Articles of Association. 
Equity holdings that exceed 10% of the voting rights 
According to the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG), every 
investor who reaches, exceeds or falls below certain proportions of 
voting rights through acquisition, sale or in any other way must 
notify us and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). 
The lowest threshold for this notification requirement is 3%. 
According to the notification of voting rights dated 4 June 2013, 
the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund, Federal Republic of 
Germany, holds a stake of 17.15% in the voting capital of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. Provided that the voting rights 
are unchanged, the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund would 
hold a stake of approximately 15.75% in the voting capital of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft following the capital increase in 
April 2015 and the share buyback in June 2023. 
Shares with special rights granting powers of control 
There are no shares with special rights granting powers of control.  
Appointment and removal of the members of the  
Board of Managing Directors; amendments to the 
Articles of Association 
The members of the Board of Managing Directors are appointed 
and removed by the Supervisory Board pursuant to Art. 84 of the 
German Stock Corporation Act and Art. 6 (2) of the Articles of 
Association. Before members of the Board of Managing Directors 
are appointed it must be demonstrated to the German Federal 
Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), the Deutsche Bundesbank 
and the European Central Bank (ECB) that they are fit and proper 
and have sufficient time available. Being fit and proper requires 
them to have sufficient theoretical and practical knowledge of the 
Bank’s business and management experience (Art. 24 (1) no. 1, 
Art. 25c (1) of the German Banking Act (KWG), Art. 93 of 
Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 (SSM Framework Regulation)). 
Pursuant to Art. 6 (1) of the Articles of Association, the Board of 
Managing Directors must comprise a minimum of two people; 
otherwise, the Supervisory Board defines the number of members 
on the Board of Managing Directors in accordance with Art. 6 (2) 
of the Articles of Association. If there is a vacancy on the Board of 
Managing Directors for a required member and the Supervisory 
Board has not appointed a new member, in urgent cases one will 
be appointed by a court pursuant to Art. 85 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act.  
Any amendment to the Articles of Association requires a 
resolution of the Annual General Meeting under Art. 179 (1) 
sentence 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act. Unless the law 
mandates a majority of the share capital represented at the date of 
resolution, a simple majority of the capital represented, in addition 
to a simple majority of the votes, is sufficient to pass resolutions 
(Art. 19 (3) sentence 2 of the Articles of Association). The authority 
to amend the Articles of Association, provided such amendments 
affect merely the wording of an article with no change in 
substance, has been transferred to the Supervisory Board under 
Art. 10 (3) of the Articles of Association in compliance with Art. 
179 (1) sentence 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act. 
Powers of the Board of Managing Directors to issue  
and buy back shares 
The Board of Managing Directors is authorised, subject to the 
detailed provisions of Art. 4 (3) and (4) of the Articles of 
Association in effect on 31 December 2023, to increase the share

more occasions until 30 May 2028, but by no more than a total of

• By 
up 
to 
€438,325,172.00 
against 
cash 
contributions 
(Authorised Capital 2023/I). The Board of Managing Directors 
is authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to 
exclude subscription rights in order to (i) exclude fractional 
amounts from the subscription rights or (ii) issue employee 
shares to employees up to a proportional amount of the share 
capital of €15,000,000.00. 
• By up to €125,235,763.00 against cash or non-cash 
contributions (Authorised Capital 2023/II). The Board of 
Managing Directors is authorised, with the approval of the 
Supervisory Board, to exclude subscription rights in order to (i) 
exclude fractional amounts from the subscription rights; (ii) to 
the extent necessary, grant subscription rights to new shares to 
holders of conversion or option rights; (iii) increase the share 
capital against contributions in kind; or (iv) issue new shares 
against cash contributions to the extent of no more than 10% 
of the Bank’s share capital at the time the authorisation 
becomes effective or at the time the authorisation is exercised, 
whichever amount is lower, if the issue price of the new shares 
is not significantly lower than the stock market price for shares 
of the same class at the time the issue price is determined. For 
the determination of the maximum limit of 10% of the share 
capital, the offsetting rules set out in the Articles of Association 
apply. 
 
The proportional amount of the share capital attributable to 
those shares issued in exchange for cash or contributions in kind 
subject to exclusion of shareholders’ subscription rights must not, 
in aggregate, exceed 10% of the share capital of the Bank existing 
at the time when the Annual General Meeting adopts the 
resolution. If shares are issued to members of the Board of 
Managing Directors, members of the management or employees 
of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and its Group companies 
within the meaning of Art. 18 (1) of the German Stock Corporation 
Act, subject to the exclusion of shareholders’ subscription rights, 
the Board of Managing Directors may make use of the 
authorisation only up to a maximum total amount of 3% of the 
share capital existing at the time when the Annual General 
Meeting adopts the resolution. For the determination of this 3% 
limit, the offsetting rules set out in the Articles of Association 
apply. For details of the authorised capital, particularly regarding 
maturities and terms and conditions of exercise, please refer to the 
detailed explanations in Note 59. 
The Board of Managing Directors was authorised by the Annual 
General Meeting on 13 May 2020 in accordance with Art. 71 (1) 
no. 8 of the German Stock Corporation Act to acquire own shares 
in a volume of up to 10% of the share capital existing at the time 
of the resolution or of the share capital existing at the time of the 
exercise of the present authorisation, whichever amount is lower, 
until 12 May 2025. Together with the Bank’s treasury shares 
purchased for other reasons and held by the Bank or attributable 
to it pursuant to Art. 71a ff. of the German Stock Corporation Act, 
the shares purchased on the basis of this authorisation must at no 
time exceed 10% of the Bank’s share capital.  
At the discretion of the Board of Managing Directors, the 
shares may be acquired on the stock exchange or by means of a 
public purchase offer addressed to all shareholders. The 
permissible consideration for the acquisition of the shares 
(excluding ancillary costs) is subject to certain limits specified in 
the authorisation for both acquisition options. If, in the event of a 
public purchase offer, the volume of shares offered exceeds the 
intended repurchase volume, acceptance may be made in 
proportion to the respective shares offered. Provision may be 
made for preferential acceptance of small numbers of up to 50 
shares of the Bank offered for purchase per shareholder (minimum 
allotment). The authorisation to acquire own shares may be 
exercised once or several times, in whole or in partial amounts, 
and in combination with the aforementioned acquisition options. 
The Board of Managing Directors was authorised to use 
repurchased shares as follows in accordance with the resolution of 
the Annual General Meeting: 
 
• sale of treasury shares on the stock exchange or by means of 
an offer to all shareholders; 
• sale of treasury shares against a non-cash contribution for the 
purpose of acquiring companies, parts of companies or equity 
interests in companies as well as other assets; 
• in the event of the sale of treasury shares by means of an offer 
to all shareholders, the granting of a subscription right for 
holders of conversion or option rights, as would be due to them 
after exercising the conversion or option right or after 
fulfilment of a corresponding conversion or option obligation; 
• issue of treasury shares (i) as employee shares to employees up 
to a proportional amount of the share capital of €15,000,000.00 
or (ii) as a component of remuneration through the granting of 
shares to members of the Board of Managing Directors, 
members of the management or employees of Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft and its Group companies within the meaning 
of Art. 18 (1) of the German Stock Corporation Act; 
• sale of treasury shares other than on the stock exchange or by 
means of an offer to all shareholders, provided that the 
purchase price is not significantly lower than the stock market 
price of the shares at the time of the sale. This authorisation 
may be exercised only if it is ensured that the number of shares 
sold on the basis of this authorisation does not exceed 10% of 
the existing share capital of the Bank at the time the 
authorisation takes effect or at the time the authorisation is 
exercised, whichever amount is lower. For the determination of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
38 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
the maximum limit of 10% of the share capital, the offsetting 
rules set out in the authorisation apply. 
 
The Board of Managing Directors may make use of the 
authorisations to exclude subscription rights for the use of 
treasury shares as employee shares, as a component of 
remuneration by providing shares to members of the Board of 
Managing Directors, members of management or employees and 
for the issue of treasury shares in return for non-cash 
contributions to members of the Board of Managing Directors, 
members of management or employees by means of the 
contribution of claims to variable remuneration components, 
bonuses or similar claims against the Bank or its Group companies 
only up to a total maximum of 3% of the share capital existing at 
the time the resolution is adopted by the Annual General Meeting. 
For the determination of this 3% limit, the offsetting rules set out 
in the authorisation apply. 
The aforementioned authorisations to use treasury shares may 
be exercised once or several times, in whole or in part, 
individually or jointly. The treasury shares may be used for one or 
more of the aforementioned purposes. Shareholders’ subscription 
rights in respect of resold Commerzbank shares have been 
excluded to the extent that these shares are used in accordance 
with the authorisations set out in points 2 to 5 above. 
The Board of Managing Directors was further authorised to 
redeem shares acquired on the basis of this authorisation without 
the implementation of the redemption requiring a further 
resolution by the Annual General Meeting. 
In addition to the authorisation described above, the Board of 
Managing Directors was authorised by the Annual General Meeting 
on 13 May 2020, pursuant to Art. 71 (1) no. 8 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act, to acquire own shares by using put or call options 
and forward purchase contracts too. Accordingly, the Bank may sell 
put options to third parties and purchase call options from third 
parties for physical delivery as well as enter into forward purchase 
agreements for which there are more than two trading days 
between the conclusion of the purchase agreement for the own 
shares and the settlement by delivery of the shares (hereinafter 
collectively “Derivatives”). The terms and conditions of these 
derivatives must ensure that the derivatives entail delivery of only 
shares that have themselves been acquired in compliance with the 
principle of equal treatment; the acquisition of shares on the stock 
exchange is sufficient for this purpose. Under this condition, a 
combination of the aforementioned derivatives may also be used. 
The authorisation to acquire own shares using derivatives may be 
exercised once or several times, in full or in partial amounts. 
All share purchases using derivatives are limited to shares up 
to the amount of 5% of the share capital existing at the time of the 
adoption of the resolution by the Annual General Meeting on this 
authorisation or of the share capital existing at the time of the 
exercise of this authorisation, whichever amount is lower. The 
term of each derivative may not exceed 18 months and must be 
determined in such a way that the acquisition of shares through 
the exercise of the derivatives occurs no later than 12 May 2025. 
The price (excluding ancillary costs) agreed in a derivative for 
the acquisition of a share upon the exercise of options or the 
settlement of forward purchases is subject to certain limits specified 
in the authorisation, as is the acquisition price to be paid by the 
Bank for options, the sales price received by the Bank for options 
and the forward price agreed by the Bank for forward purchases.  
If own shares are acquired using derivatives in compliance with 
the above provisions, a right of the shareholders to enter into such 
derivative transactions with the Bank is excluded by analogous 
application of Art. 186 (3) sentence 4 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act. Shareholders have a right to tender their shares 
in the Bank only to the extent that the Bank has an obligation to 
them under the derivative transactions to take delivery of the 
shares. Any further right to tender is excluded. 
The rules described above for directly repurchased shares 
apply to the use of shares acquired using derivatives. 
Material agreements in the event of a change of control 
following a takeover bid 
In the event of a change of control at Commerzbank due to a 
merger or transfer of assets, an extraordinary right of termination 
in favour of certain contract parties has been negotiated by 
Commerzbank under ISDA master agreements. In general, the 
right of termination is also conditional upon a material 
deterioration in Commerzbank’s credit standing. In the event of 
this type of termination, the individual agreements signed under 
these master agreements would have to be settled at market value, 
which can be determined on any stock exchange trading day. 
However, the possibility cannot be excluded that, if an individual 
customer with an especially large volume of business terminates a 
contract, Commerzbank’s assets, liabilities, financial position and 
financial performance could nevertheless be heavily impacted due 
to the Bank’s potential payment obligations. 
Compensation agreements in the event of a  
takeover offer 
There are no compensation agreements in the event of a takeover 
offer, either with the members of the Board of Managing Directors 
or with employees of Commerzbank.

German Commercial Code (HGB) 
The aim of the internal control and risk management system in 
respect of financial reporting is to ensure that the annual financial 
statements 
of 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft 
and 
the 
Commerzbank Group provide a true and fair view of the assets,

liabilities, financial position and financial performance in accordance 
with the applicable accounting standards under the German 
Commercial Code and IFRS. The internal control system and the risk 
management system at Commerzbank are linked with each other, 
both with a view to financial reporting. Below, we shall therefore use 
the term ICS (internal control system). Details of the risk 
management system can be found in the risk report on page 219 f. 
The objective of proper and reliable financial reporting is 
endangered if material information in the financial reporting is 
erroneous. It is irrelevant whether this is due to one single matter 
or a combination of several. Risks to financial reporting may arise 
from errors in the accounting processes. Fraudulent behaviour can 
also result in the misstatement of information. The Bank therefore 
has to ensure it minimises the risks of incorrect statement, 
measurement or presentation of material information in the 
financial reporting. The Commerzbank ICS is designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that the relevant legal requirements are 
complied with, that business is conducted in a proper and cost-
effective manner and that financial reporting is complete and 
accurate. 
Legal basis and guidelines 
Art. 315 (4) of the German Commercial Code requires capital 
market-oriented companies to describe the material features of 
their ICS in the management report. Commerzbank follows the 
principles for bank-specific organisation of the internal control 
system set out in the Minimum Requirements for Risk 
Management (MaRisk).  
The Bank’s internal control system is structured in line with the 
internationally recognised framework developed by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
Commerzbank derives the following objectives from this: 
 
• that business processes be effective and efficient, 
• that applicable laws and regulations be observed and 
• that financial reporting be reliable. 
 
As regards the risk assessment of the reporting process 
required by COSO in respect of the reliability of financial 
reporting (for example, ensuring that all transactions are fully and 
correctly recognised in the financial statements), the Bank follows 
the recommendations of the International Standard on Auditing 
(ISA) 315. 
Organisation 
The written rules of procedure form a sound basis for good 
corporate governance that provides strategic direction for the 
Group as a whole while taking account of risk elements.  
These rules are defined as the transparent description, to be 
updated on an ongoing basis, of the organisational structure and 
processes of a company, including powers. The binding standard 
required by regulation for the organisational structure is set down 
in the policy on the written rules of procedure and the process 
framework. These form the framework for descriptions and 
documentation of instructions, including processes. Documenting 
and updating the organisational structure are seen as part of the 
written rules of procedure and sets consistent and binding 
minimum requirements as a governance framework for all 
corporate units. The primary feature is the principle of clear 
allocation of responsibility, starting with the schedule of business 
responsibilities for the Board of Managing Directors and then for 
the global functional leads for Group functions, and ending with 
administrative cost approval authorities at the lower management 
levels. The scope and structure of the governance framework 
follow both the legal and regulatory requirements and also the 
“Commerzbank corporate constitution” approved by the Board of 
Managing Directors. The governance framework translates the 
main guiding principles of the corporate constitution into practical 
rules and comprises the following elements: 
 
• schedule of business responsibilities for the Board of Managing 
Directors, 
• business remits of the units, 
• rules of procedure, 
• organisational charts and 
• approval authorities for administrative costs. 
 
The organisational control and monitoring units that ensure a 
functioning and efficient control structure are aligned in three 
successive levels at Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. The three 
lines of defence model is a central element in Commerzbank’s 
corporate constitution. In addition, where tasks in the Bank by 
their nature cannot be combined, they are organised into different 
areas applying the principle of separation of functions. Strict 
checks are also carried out using the dual-control principle to 
minimise risks in financial reporting. 
In accordance with MaRisk, responsibility for implementing, 
executing, applying, refining and reviewing the Bank-wide ICS lies 
with the Board of Managing Directors. The Board of Managing 
Directors is responsible for designing the Group-wide ICS and 
demonstrating that it is appropriate, while the CFO is responsible 
for designing the ICS over financial reporting and ensuring its 
operating effectiveness for this purpose. The CFO is responsible 
for the design of the ICS through appropriate and effective control 
steps and for embedding these into the various processes. The 
Board of Managing Directors is also responsible for ensuring that 
the financial statements for the parent company and Group are 
properly prepared.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
The Supervisory Board is supported in its oversight of the 
financial reporting primarily by the Audit Committee set up for this 
purpose. It provides support in monitoring the accounting process 
and the effectiveness of the risk management system (especially 
the internal control system), compliance and the internal audit 
function. It also provides support in monitoring the performance 
of the annual audit, particularly with regard to the independence 
of the auditor and the services provided by the auditor. The Audit 
Committee also monitors remediation of deficiencies identified by 
the auditor within the scope of the follow-up and reporting done 
by the internal audit function (Group Audit). 
Group Audit reports to the Supervisory Board and its appointed 
committees in line with regulatory requirements and by means of 
summary quarterly reports about the work it has carried out and 
its material findings. Group Finance (GMF), which reports directly 
to the CFO, is responsible for ensuring that the financial 
statements are drawn up in compliance with the relevant laws and 
internal 
and 
external 
guidelines. 
Within 
GMF, 
the 
Financial & Management Reporting unit is responsible for the 
intranet-based provision of accounting guidelines. Implementation 
of these accounting guidelines supports consistent and correct 
financial reporting across the Group. The cluster delivery 
organisation within GMF is responsible for the operation and 
ongoing technical and functional development of the infrastructure 
for core finance processes. 
Controls to minimise risk 
Controls at the Bank are integrated directly into operating 
processes, either technically or manually (i.e. by means of 
organisation). Technical controls are used in the IT systems 
employed and consist, for example, of check sums and verification 
digits. Technical controls are often complemented by manual 
controls such as screen approvals carried out by the responsible 
employees. Further measures such as approval authorities, the 
separation of functions and the issuing of IT permissions also help 
increase data quality. Additional controls are in place during 
further processing to check that the data entered is complete and 
accurate. 
Monitoring by Group Audit 
Group Audit (GMA) is the internal audit function and provides 
independent, objective and risk-oriented auditing and advisory 
services on behalf of the Board of Managing Directors. It supports 
the Bank in achieving its business objectives, using a systematic 
and targeted approach to evaluate the effectiveness of risk 
management, controls and management and monitoring processes 
and to help to improve them. The scope of its work encompasses 
all the Bank’s activities, irrespective of whether they have been 
outsourced or not. 
Group Audit is directly accountable to and reports to the full 
Board of Managing Directors. In performing its duties, it has a full 
and unrestricted right to information. GMA performs its functions 
autonomously and independently. Particularly with regard to 
reporting and the assessment of audit results, GMA is not subject 
to any directives. GMA’s activities complement the work of the 
subsidiaries’ internal audit departments within the framework of 
Group risk management. It may involve these departments in its 
auditing activities.  
GMA promptly prepares a written report on each audit; 
recipients include the responsible members of the Board of 
Managing Directors. On the basis of internal and external audit 
reports, GMA oversees and documents the steps taken to remedy 
any reported deficiencies within the period of time specified for 
this. If the required action is not taken in time, an escalation 
process comes into effect. Besides its quarterly summary reports, 
GMA also prepares an annual report on the audits that it has 
carried out during the course of the financial year, adherence to 
the audit plan, significant deficiencies according to MaRisk and 
the corrective measures taken and presents this report to the 
Board of Managing Directors. 
The financial reporting process 
The financial reporting processes at Commerzbank are supported 
by IT systems integrated into each process. The annual financial 
statements of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft in Germany are 
produced using a financial architecture consisting of a financial 
data warehouse that provides a consistent repository of basic 
information, and standard SAP software for the financial function. 
The parent company in Germany therefore has a single solution 
using consistent financial data for the financial statements under 
both IFRS and the German Commercial Code. 
As part of the input process for financial reporting, all 
information relevant for drawing up the financial statements of 
Commerzbank 
Group 
under 
IFRS 
and 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft under the German Commercial Code is 
submitted to GMF by the reporting units. Data is transmitted via 
an online data entry functionality directly into SAP ECCS 
consolidation software, which has been adapted to the Bank’s 
requirements. Subsidiaries submit IFRS data; German and foreign 
branches also submit data under the German Commercial Code. 
Data is automatically checked for consistency before transmission 
to GMF. Once the plausibility checks have been successfully 
completed, the individual reports can be finalised. GMF uses this 
data to prepare the separate financial statements of Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft, to take all the necessary steps to produce the 
Group financial statements and to perform further plausibility 
checks.

Drawing up the Group financial statements involves individual 
consolidation steps (e.g. consolidating equity, liabilities, income 
and expenses), currency translation and the elimination of intra-
Group profits. 
IFRS segment reporting is done on a separate IT system. This 
involves reconciliation with the data from accounting. 
Measures to further enhance the ICS  
for financial reporting 
The ICS for financial reporting has been adapted to meet the 
needs of the Commerzbank Group and it is enhanced further on an 
ongoing basis. To this end, Control Environment Finance (CEF) 
has been permanently implemented at Group Finance. CEF is 
based on the GMF “process map”. This is a top-down 
representation of all key processes, which is refined with 
descriptions of procedures and in which the risks in relation to the 
reliability of financial reporting are determined, applying the 
COSO framework. The Bank also follows the recommendations of 
International Standard on Auditing (ISA) 315.  
Suitable controls are implemented to minimise the risks 
identified. With respect to the effectiveness of the ICS, the way in 
which the controls are designed in the form of appropriate steps 
and embedded into the respective processes and the way the 
controls are performed at the operating level are decisive factors 
in minimising risk. 
The ICS for financial reporting is reinforced by regular 
assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of key controls and 
regular checks on how controls are implemented.  
This procedure ensures that risks are identified and minimised 
and that any potential negative developments on the operational 
side are avoided. 
Other 
No material changes have been made to the financial reporting 
ICS since the reporting date.

About this report 
 
This

non-financial 
report 
for 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft and the Commerzbank Group 1  has been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the German Act 
on Strengthening Corporate Non-Financial Reporting (CSR-
Richtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz, CSR-RUG). Alongside the parent 
company, it covers in particular the material subsidiaries 
according to the risk inventory, Commerz Real AG, mBank S.A. 
and Commerzbank Finance & Covered Bond S.A.

responsibility, respect for human rights and the fight against 
corruption and bribery. As customer focus is key factor in our 
success, we also report on the treatment of customers. To identify 
the topics to report on, we conducted a materiality analysis of non-
financial issues that are key to understanding the business 
performance and situation of Commerzbank and that are 
significantly impacted by our business activities (see section “Key 
topics analysed”). The description of the business model can be 
found in the “Structure and organisation” section of the (Group) 
management report. Apart from the description of the business 
model, references to further information in the management report 
do not form part of this non-financial report. Other references to 
information outside the management report are marked accordingly.

The directives stipulated by Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft 
apply to the entire Group because it is defined as the “global 
functional lead”. If relevant arrangements at the subsidiaries differ 
from these policies, these arrangements are explained in this report. 
Commerzbank Finance & Covered Bond S.A., which as at the end of 
2023 had around 30 remaining employees and was exclusively 
managing a run-off portfolio, did not have any additional 
information to contribute on material non-financial issues in 2023.  
No new material non-financial risks were identified as part of 
the annual risk inventory that had not already been taken into 
sufficient account in the Bank’s risk management. We are not 
aware of any material risks in this regard, either from the Bank’s 
own business activities or in connection with business relations, 
products or services, that would be highly likely to have a severe 
negative impact on the non-financial aspects, now or in the future. 
Further information on our risk management can be found in the 
Group risk report. 
In the interests of providing focused information to the 
recipients of our financial reporting, we have refrained from using 
a reporting framework. Nevertheless, this non-financial report is 
guided by the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
where relevant for the defined issues. Detailed information on the 
sustainability work of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is also 
presented in the GRI sustainability reporting, which is available 
online. In this non-financial report, we take into account the 
requirements of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD), of which we have been a member since 2020 
(see table “TCFD recommendations in the non-financial report” on 
page 78 f.). This year, we are also aligning ourselves for the first 
time with the requirements of the Taskforce on Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures (TNFD), which we joined in April 2023 (see 
table “TNFD recommendations in the non-financial report” on page 
80 f.). We have also included information required by the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation. Our progress report on the Principles for 
Responsible 
Banking 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Environment 
Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) is also integrated into this 
report and summarised as a tabular index at the end of the report. 
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
form a further basis for our sustainability efforts. In this report, we 
show how our activities support the achievement of these global 
sustainability goals (see SDG symbols at the start of the relevant 
section). Financing renewable energy, for example, contributes 
towards SDG 7, which seeks to ensure access to affordable and 
clean energy. A detailed overview of our contribution to target 
achievement can be found in the sustainability section of 
Commerzbank’s website.  
This non-financial report was subject to a limited assurance 
engagement performed by the auditing firm KPMG in accordance 
with ISAE 3000 (Revised)2. The report on the engagement can be 
found in the Group’s Annual Report under “Further information”. 
1. Taking responsibility 
 
Our society is facing challenges from multiple sides. 2023 was 
overshadowed by the ongoing Russian war of aggression in 
Ukraine, Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel, a deteriorating German 
economic climate and devastating natural disasters. In times when 
society and the economy are fighting an uphill battle, it is more 
important than ever that we stand by our customers.  
In our ESG framework, we disclose all the key building blocks of 
our sustainability strategy. It is where we bundle all the information 
relevant to our stakeholders on sustainability issues in the customer 
business, on our sustainable product solutions as well as on our 
guidelines and exclusion criteria. Transparency and fairness towards 
our customers are cornerstones of doing business sustainably. 
Treating our employees responsibly – even and especially at times of 
economic challenges and great upheaval – is another. 
With our net zero commitment – i.e. the promise to reduce our 
carbon footprint to net zero – we as a financial intermediary are 
driving sustainability. We follow binding rules for dealing with 
environmental and social risks, which we continuously review and 
adapt as necessary. We have a clear position on controversial 
topics such as fossil fuels, arms, deforestation and mining. 
In the following, we explain in detail how we specifically fulfil our 
responsibility towards the environment, society, our customers and 
employees, which successes we have achieved in the year under 
review and what we are still working on. We outline what matters to 
us and what we stand for. The chart “Milestones in 2023” 
summarises our key activities, which we discuss in the body of the 
report. To highlight our progress in the individual areas, we specify 
strategic KPIs (key performance indicators) and other key figures. 
Our sustainability rating and ranking results and our inclusion 
in the relevant indices demonstrate that we are on the right track. 
In 
2023, 
major 
rating 
agencies 
for 
sustainability 
gave 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft ratings that were mainly 
positive. For example, Sustainalytics gives us a “medium risk” 
rating, while CPD rates us “B”. In S&P Global’s Corporate 
Sustainability Assessment, Commerzbank achieved a score of 54 – 
an improvement of 8 points on the previous year. In addition, we 
continue to be listed in sustainability indices such as FTSE4Good. 
On top of this, two of our projects received the German Award for 
Sustainability Projects 2023 in the year under review: specifically, 
the ESG framework and the environmental internship. Out of the 
total 283 nominations received, Commerzbank scored top marks

which is published online and constantly updated.  
Our subsidiary mBank also performs well in this respect: MSCI

Sustainalytics assessed its risk profile as “low”. mBank is also 
listed in the WIG-ESG index of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. 
Milestones in 2023 
 
 
 
2. Anchoring sustainability 
in our strategy 
 
The transformation into a sustainable economy affects our 
customers and ourselves in equal measure. We want to play an 
active role in shaping this change. Sustainability has been an 
integral part of our corporate strategy since as far back as 2020. 
The “Strategy 2027” published in November 2023 is based on the 
three 
pillars 
of 
growth, 
excellence 
and 
responsibility. 
Responsibility represents the entire sustainability spectrum of 
environmental, social and governance. 
 
 
 
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 
the Paris climate target of limiting global warming to well below 
2°C provide the framework for our work. To this end, we are 
constantly expanding our range of innovative, environmentally 
friendly products and our sustainable solutions for customers. We 
are also driving forward the sustainable transformation of our 
banking operations. Our sustainability strategy is grounded in our 
commitment to combating climate change. With that in mind, we 
have set ourselves ambitious net zero targets and are pursuing 
these with consistency and conviction. In addition, we tackle 
issues that are moving into the focus of the sustainability debate, 
such as biodiversity protection and a resource-conserving circular 
economy. We need to find strategic solutions to these issues in 
conjunction with our customers. 
Our commitment to sustainable transformation is also made 
clear by our voluntary undertakings. For example, we were one of 
the first signatories of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance of the United 
Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). By 
joining the “Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures” 
(TNFD) in 2023, we have underlined our resolve to make an active 
contribution to preserving biodiversity. An overview of all our 
memberships in the field of sustainability is published online.

Governance structures consolidated  
Among other matters, the Supervisory Board advises and monitors 
the Board of Managing Directors with regard to sustainability 
issues. This includes, for example, checking this non-financial 
report. The Environmental, Social and Governance Committee 
(ESG Committee) generally meets four times a year. Together with 
the Audit Committee, it assists the Supervisory Board in assessing 
whether the management is ensuring the economically viable and 
sustainable performance of the Bank while also observing the 
principles of responsible corporate governance, fulfilling the 
Bank’s social responsibility and at the same time conserving 
natural resources. The ESG Committee also advises the Board of 
Managing Directors on ESG issues.  
As part of the optimisation of the remuneration system for the 
Board of Managing Directors, the Supervisory Board has linked 
Commerzbank’s 
sustainability 
strategy 
to 
the 
variable 
remuneration of members of the Board of Managing Directors in a 
binding manner by adding an explicit ESG sub-target within the 
Group target, accounting for 20% of Group target achievement. 
The Group target itself accounts for the majority (60%) of variable 
remuneration for members of the Board of Managing Directors. As 
a result, ESG targets have been explicitly embedded in the 
variable remuneration system since the 2023 financial year for all 
members of the Board of Managing Directors via the Group target. 
They complement any other ESG targets within the department 
and individual targets that may have already been in place in 
previous years. Alongside other ESG criteria, the Bank’s 
sustainability targets are also embedded in the remuneration 
system for our employees as target criteria. As an integral 
component of the qualitative targets, these criteria – together with 
target achievement in the quantitative element – determine the 
amount 
of 
variable 
remuneration 
in 
the 
non-pay-scale 
remuneration model. 
The Board of Managing Directors develops the Commerzbank 
Group’s strategy, discusses it with the Supervisory Board and 
ensures it is implemented. Sustainability issues are included in the 
annual strategy process for the overall bank strategy and are 
discussed as required in meetings of the Board of Managing 
Directors. Each member of the Board of Managing Directors is 
responsible for implementing sustainability measures within their 
own divisional remit.  
 
 
 
The central sustainability management function reports to the 
Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors and regularly 
informs him about progress on sustainability issues and activities. 
A cross-divisional decision-making and escalation body for 
sustainability enables the sustainable orientation of the business 
model to be managed holistically. With this Group Sustainability 
Board, we have firmly embedded the wide-ranging issue of 
sustainability within the Bank’s organisation. The board sets the 
Bank’s strategic sustainability targets and monitors the measures 
for their implementation and management. In addition, the 
divisions and segments report regularly on the progress of their 
sustainability activities and the implementation of regulatory 
sustainability requirements. The Group Sustainability Board is 
chaired by the Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors. The 
Board also includes other members of the Board of Managing 
Directors and heads of divisions. 
By making Group Sustainability Management the overarching 
sustainability area within the strategy unit, Commerzbank is 
underlining the strategic priority of this topic. It is responsible for 
the ongoing development of the sustainability strategy and 
comprehensive 
governance. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
Group 
Sustainability Management manages the “Sustainability 360°” 
Group-wide programme and thereby coordinates the sustainability 
work of Commerzbank in an overarching way. It also ensures the 
implementation of strategic sustainability initiatives such as the 
Principles for Responsible Banking of the UNEP FI.  
The external Sustainability Advisory Board, led by the 
Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors, ensures a 
constructive and critical dialogue with our stakeholders. The six 
experts from the fields of politics, academia, society, NGOs, trade 
unions and SMEs represent a broad spectrum of content. Previous 
meetings included the discussion of topics such as the circular 
economy, biodiversity and social sustainability. The input from the 
Sustainability Advisory Board supports us in the further 
development of our sustainability strategy.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Under the three lines of defence approach, ESG risks are viewed 
as a horizontal type of risk and are therefore managed across 
various 
control 
units 
at 
the 
Bank. 
Group 
Sustainability 
Management also acts the second line of defence for social (S) and 
governance (G) risks, serving as a central point of oversight. 
Environmental (E) risks are dealt with within the risk control 
function. The Chief Environmental Risk Officer (CERO) and the 
associated Environmental Risk Control unit deal specifically with 
climate and biodiversity risks. Together, these two units monitor 
the impact of ESG risks on the Bank’s risk profile. 
The relevance of sustainability is also reflected in Commerz 
Real’s organisational structure. A central department for strategic 
sustainability issues began its work in May 2023. This Centre of 
Competence Sustainable Transformation & Strategy is part of the 
Real Estate Asset Management & Sustainability (RE-AMS) division. 
The department is responsible for devising the sustainability 
strategy of Commerz Real and its subsidiaries, and also supports 
and monitors the operational implementation of this strategy. The 
department management reports to the general representative for 
RE-AMS, who in turn reports on sustainability issues directly to 
the Board of Managing Directors. 
At mBank, the Sustainable Development Committee, chaired by 
the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for managing sustainability. It 
coordinates sustainability activities and proposes them to the 
Board of Managing Directors. The committee also monitors the 
implementation of the ESG strategy and the progress of ESG 
initiatives, and approves related measures. Furthermore, the Board 
of Managing Directors maintains regular dialogue with the 
Supervisory Board on sustainability issues, while the Risk 
Committee of the Supervisory Board addresses sustainability 
matters on a quarterly basis. In addition, the evaluation of 
mBank’s top 100 managers is partly (10%) linked to ESG targets. 
Keeping an eye on regulatory developments 
Commerzbank monitors the growing number of regulatory 
requirements at national, international and EU levels. As part of 
this, Group Sustainability Management keeps an eye on 
developments relating to sustainability issues and coordinates 
implementation with the relevant units of the Bank. The aim is to 
further integrate sustainability and ESG risks into the Bank’s 
strategy, governance and risk management, and to create suitable 
conditions for mobilising capital. The current focus of regulatory 
requirements is on considering the effects of climate change on 
business activities and on ensuring standardised disclosure of the 
Bank’s contribution to the transformation.  
Corporate responsibility also means seeking regular dialogue 
with external and internal stakeholders. Commerzbank maintains 
contact with numerous organisations and groups that have a 
relationship with the Bank. In addition to employees, these include 
above all customers, the capital market, the financial sector, 
suppliers and service providers, the media, non-governmental 
organisations, politicians, civil society and academics.  
 
 
 
Commerzbank also engages in regular dialogue with national 
and international regulatory and supervisory authorities. The 
Bank’s aim here is to get to know the needs and interests of its 
stakeholders and present its own perspective. The outcome of 
these discussions can be incorporated into the corporate strategy 
as a decision-making and planning aid. For example, the Bank 
regularly discusses the potential impact of our business activities 
on human beings and the environment with non-governmental 
organisations. In November 2023, Commerzbank hosted one of 
the nine events held during the seventh Sustainable Finance 
Summit of the Green and Sustainable Finance Cluster Germany. 
The programme welcomed the banks of the Net-Zero Banking 
Alliance Germany and discussed the topic of climate-neutral banks 
as well as the key role they play in transforming the economy. 
Key issues analysed 
This non-financial report is based on the materiality analysis from 
2022, which we used to identify the sustainability topics that are 
most relevant to us. For this purpose, potential sustainability 
topics were analysed along the two established materiality 
perspectives. To measure the impact perspective, we conducted an 
exposure analysis to reveal “sustainability hotspots”. These are in 
countries and sectors where Commerzbank is particularly active, 
and where sustainability indicators in the defined areas are 
significantly below average. The business perspective – i.e. the 
question of how high the opportunities and risks of these 
sustainability issues are for business success – was established in 
a management workshop.  
Nine topics are consequently material for us. They relate to all 
three sustainability dimensions – environmental, social and 
governance – and currently form the focus of our sustainability 
management activities. Climate change continues to have the 
highest relevance for the Bank. At the same time, topics such as 
biodiversity and circular solutions have shifted into greater focus 
than in previous materiality analyses. To apply the materiality 
analysis in the Bank’s operations, the results were incorporated 
into the Bank-wide strategy process and discussed at the level of 
the Board of Managing Directors.  
Corporate responsibility also means
seeking regular dialogue with
external and internal stakeholders

Results matrix for the materiality analysis 
 
 
 
In mid-2023, we carried out a new materiality analysis pursuant to 
the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD) passed by the EU at the end of 2022. The new 
guideline came into force in 2023, meaning we will have to 
implement it for the first time from the 2024 reporting year. It 
therefore has no relevance for current reporting. A Group-wide 
project to ensure timely implementation was started in 2023. The 
next non-financial report will be aligned to the new CSRD 
requirements.  
Pursuing net zero target  
Our 
net 
zero 
commitme
nt is at the 
heart 
of 
the sustainability strategy adopted by the Board of Managing 
Directors. It is based on two pillars: We support our customers in 
their sustainable transformations and set a good example 
ourselves. We are pursuing this by means of three specific targets: 
 
 
 
• By 2050 we are aiming for net zero CO2 emissions from our 
entire lending and investment portfolio. To measure progress 
reliably, we use CO2 reduction targets from the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi). We are already using this method to 
align our portfolios with the Paris Agreement and will also base 
our management on it from 2025 at the latest (see “Reducing 
financed emissions”). 
• By 2025, we will mobilise €300bn for sustainable financial 
products. These products represent our sustainable business 
volume, with €100bn attributable to the Private and Small-
Business Customers segment and €200bn to the Corporate 
Clients segment. The goal of mobilising around €300bn by 
2025 takes into account not only the provision of capital, but 
also funds that customers were able to obtain on the capital 
market with the help of Commerzbank, for example via 
sustainable bonds and sustainable loans. In the ESG 
framework, we disclose the criteria we use to classify financial 
products as sustainable and transparently describe the 
composition of the sustainable business volume. In view of 
factors such as the evolving EU Taxonomy, we will realign the 
volume target accordingly. We will also further expand the 
range of sustainable products offered in our business divisions 
(see “Taking climate-related risks into account in lending” and 
“Sustainable investments and capital market products”). Key 
figure: By the end of 2023, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft 
had mobilised €238bn for sustainable financial products, out of 
a target of €300bn by the end of 2025. 
 
 
 
There was a significant increase in 2023 for sustainable bonds in 
particular with a total volume of €61bn. Due to a notable 
slowdown in sustainable financing on the credit market in 2023, 
the volume of new business in this area fell to €75bn compared to 
the previous year. The reason for this includes the tense interest 
rate environment and the effects of the macroeconomic downturn. 
A detailed overview of all products contributing to this goal can be 
found on page 76 (table “Composition of the €300bn target”).

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
* New business. ** Existing business. 
 
• We want to reduce the CO2 emissions of our own banking 
operations to net zero as early as 2040. We already achieved 
our target of reducing greenhouse 
gas 
emissions at 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft by a further 30% by 2025 
versus 2018 back in 2022 – three years ahead of schedule. We 
expect our suppliers to be climate-neutral by 2040. Our own 
CO2 emissions in 2023 were 76,591 tonnes (see “Reducing 
operational emissions”). 
 
The status of target achievement is regularly ascertained and 
reported internally and externally. For target 1 – managing the 
portfolio based on CO2 intensity, working towards net zero – we 
are publishing a status report for the first time in 2023 (see 
“Reducing financed emissions”). The Group Sustainability Board, 
chaired by the Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors, 
reviews the progress towards these three strategic sustainability 
targets. Our sustainability strategy is implemented within the 
Group programme “Sustainability 360°”. The customer segments, 
Risk Management and numerous other relevant Group divisions 
are involved in the Group-wide initiative, as is Commerz Real. The 
programme 
represents 
an 
overarching 
framework 
for 
all 
sustainability activities and ensures that cross-cutting issues are 
closely joined up, a coordinated approach is taken and tracking is 
strict. A steering committee consisting of members of the top 
management of the relevant divisions monitors progress every two 
months. The status of the programme is regularly reported to the 
Board of Managing Directors.

Commerz 
Real 
has 
been 
pursuing 
its 
Sustainable4Life 
sustainability strategy since 2020 and has embedded it in the 
business strategy in the four impact areas of Portfolio & Investments, 
Directives & Processes, 
Team & Stakeholders 
and 
Innovation & 
Digitalisation.  
At mBank, too, the ESG agenda is a key component of the 
business strategy for 2021 to 2025. It is guided by the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals that are relevant for it, 
and by the UNEP FI Principles for Responsible Banking. The 
strategy sets out how mBank assumes responsibility for issues 
such as climate change, for the financial situation of its customers, 
and for society and investors. mBank has committed to achieving 
carbon neutrality in its direct emissions (Scope 1) and those of the 
energy it purchases (Scope 2) by 2030. mBank plans to become 
completely carbon neutral – including its loan portfolio – by 2050. 
To this end, in 2022 it became the first Polish bank to join the 
Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF).  
This alliance enables the carbon footprint of the loan portfolio 
to be determined in accordance with recognised standards.  
mBank is also a member of the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi) to ensure that it implements its decarbonisation targets in 
line with the Paris Agreement. As part of its strategy, mBank has 
also undertaken to introduce at least one new ESG-compliant 
product per year in both the retail and corporate customer 
segments. For example, in 2022 it began offering Eco mortgage 
loans to retail banking customers for financing environmentally 
friendly buildings. This product is in line with the objectives of the 
EU Taxonomy Regulation. mBank already granted more than 700 
of these loans for energy-efficient homes in 2023, with a total 
volume of around €85m (about 374m Polish zloty). 
3. Responsible management 
 
One objective agreed under the 2015 Paris Agreement was to 
bring global financial flows into line with climate targets. Private 
finance is also needed to support our efforts to gradually 
decarbonise the global economy. Funding for new projects and 
technologies is intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
promote climate change adaptation measures. This can be done, 
for example, by promoting renewable forms of energy (See 
“Supporting the customer transformation”) or forgoing certain 
transactions such as financing new coal mines or coal-fired power 
stations. We too want to prevent our business activities from 
having a negative impact on the environment and on society and 
to avoid or mitigate any risks that might result. 
Making our stance clear  
Through our ESG framework 
we 
have 
made 
our 
understanding 
of 
and 
commitment to sustainability 
transparent 
for 
all 
stakeholders. The framework 
creates a Bank-wide standard 
that 
enables 
stringent 
management of all relevant 
products, 
processes 
and 
activities 
and 
ensures 
the 
sustainable 
transformation 
of 
Commerzbank. The focus is on our core business, specifically our 
customer and product portfolio. The ESG framework provides an 
overview of our sustainability directives and exclusion criteria. It is 
updated on a continual basis to reflect both regulatory 
developments as well as our own progress.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
The Bank has formulated industry-specific requirements for 
controversial topics such as armaments, deforestation and fossil 
fuels. For example, the Fossil Fuels Policy regulates the entire coal 
value chain from coal production, through infrastructure, to coal-
fired power generation at power plants. The value chain is also 
subject to comprehensive regulation for customers and the 
customer business from the oil and gas sector (upstream, 
midstream, downstream).  
 
 
 
Exclusion criteria were defined for particularly critical 
businesses and business relationships. This includes, for example, 
financing for oil and gas production projects (conventional and 
unconventional production methods), as well as the decision not to 
finance new construction or expansion of coal mines, coal 
infrastructure or coal-fired power plants. Exclusion criteria were 
also defined for other areas such as nuclear power and 
deforestation. For years now, environmental and biodiversity 
aspects have been integrated into the core business by means of 
minimum environmental standards and corresponding exclusion 
criteria, and compliance with these standards has been monitored. 
Evaluating environmental and social risks 
Sustainability in the core 
business is assessed by the 
Reputational 
Risk 
Management department at 
Commerzbank 
Aktien-
gesellschaft. We do not limit ourselves to what is legally required; 
instead, we consider the legitimacy of all transactions. In view of 
the special risks associated with fossil fuels and armaments, the 
Board of Managing Directors has passed its own binding 
directives on these matters that define many of the relevant 
transactions and business relationships in these areas as being 
subject to assessment, and encompass exclusion criteria.  
When it comes to armaments, we recognise the basic right of 
states to defend themselves and do not question the need for the 
German armed forces to exist or to be adequately equipped. We 
therefore continue to finance arms manufacturers who produce 
weapons and armament systems for the Federal Republic of 
Germany and its allies. Nevertheless, we have tightened and 
expanded the requirements and criteria for the arms industry 
applying to Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, which have been in 
place since 2008. The Board of Managing Directors approved the 
new Arms and Surveillance Technology Policy in January 2023. It 
preserves the fundamental parameters of the old policy, which 
means that Commerzbank will not fund arms business in conflict 
zones or areas of tension, or business relating to what are termed 
“controversial weapons”. In addition, the new policy now also 
governs the approach in relation to autonomous weapons and 
surveillance technology. For example, Commerzbank does not 
participate in transactions or projects relating to fully autonomous 
weapon systems. 
In December 2023, we also expanded our position in the areas 
of deforestation and agricultural commodities and defined new 
exclusion criteria. The expanded position on the forestry, soy, beef 
and palm oil sectors stipulates that companies from relevant and 
defined regions must have mandatory 
memberships and 
certifications in order to become or remain customers of 
Commerzbank. Existing customers must comply with these 
requirements by the end of 2025 at the latest.  
 
 
 
Commerzbank is committed to respecting human rights and 
wants to help promote and uphold these within its scope 
influence, for example in its dealings with employees, suppliers 
and customers. We describe in detail how we address this matter 
in our Position on Human Rights. In the Reputational Risk 
Management department, business transactions and business 
relationships in sectors in which human rights play a significant 
role, such as mining, ship dismantling or the cotton sector, are 
intensively 
researched, 
analysed 
and 
assessed 
in 
detail. 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft has also worked intensively on 
implementing the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence 
Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG), which entered into force on 
1 January 2023 (see “Managing compliance risks”).  
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft’s 
Reputational 
Risk 
Management department thus defines the criteria for and limits of 
business operations and assesses transactions, products and 
customer relationships after careful analysis. The assessment 
process starts in the front office: as soon as an issue defined as 
sensitive by the Bank is affected, Reputational Risk Management 
must be brought in. The assessment uses a five-point scale and 
can result in a rejection of the product, the transaction or the 
business relationship.  
According to the risk inventory, reputational risk is one of the 
main non-quantifiable risk types in the Commerzbank Group and 
is therefore managed as part of the overall risk strategy. All 
sensitive issues, positions and directives are reviewed regularly 
and updated as necessary.

Nations Global Compact. mBank’s risk management strategy is 
based on three pillars: supporting sustainable growth, striving for 
prudent and stable risk management, and strengthening its skills 
in managing ESG and cyber risks. mBank has formulated its own 
exclusion criteria for various sectors based on the EU’s climate 
and energy policies. These include the mining and energy sectors, 
among others: for example, financing for the construction or 
expansion of hard coal and lignite mines is excluded. mBank’s 
reputational risk strategy is reviewed annually and coordinated 
with the parent company. 
Recognising impacts on biodiversity 
Global 
economic 
performance 
hinges 
on 
functioning 
ecosystem 
services. A look at the 
current state of ecosystems 
and species inventories makes it clear that the time for action is 
now. To help us monitor and manage our impact on biological 
diversity going forward, in 2023 we carried out a second impact 
analysis. This analysis, performed using the “ENCORE” tool, was 
updated and expanded compared to the previous year. ENCORE 
provides a science-based link between economic activities and 
biodiversity-damaging impacts. In our analysis, we compared the 
business volume of the sectors we finance with the tool’s external 
data.  
 
 
 
As a major financier of the German economy, we are also active 
in sectors that have an adverse impact on biological diversity. 
Compared to the overall portfolio, however, we have little 
exposure to some of the hardest-hit sectors (agriculture or the 
textile industry, for example). Sectors with elevated impacts on 
biodiversity that have a sufficiently large exposure include the 
energy and automotive sectors. Water consumption, soil and water 
pollution, and waste have been identified as key drivers of 
biodiversity impacts across our portfolio.

The impact analysis enabled us to identify potential fields of action 
and strategic priorities and we plan to develop further analyses, 
measures and products to protect biodiversity. The main 
challenges in determining biodiversity-related impacts are the 
availability of relevant data and a lack of standardised metrics and 
targets. We are therefore striving to make further improvements to 
the data basis (for example, in relation to location-specific data) 
and consequently to the results of the impact analysis. 
As the topic becomes more and more relevant to society, 
regulatory requirements are also increasing. These include the 
Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the new 
edition of the National Biodiversity Strategy (NBS 2030). For this 
reason, we expect an active transformation of the economy in the 
medium to long term, bringing with it a reduction in the negative 
impact on things provided by the ecosystem. Biodiversity aspects 
are already incorporated in our ESG financing offering through 
their definition as sustainable uses in our ESG framework. 
To underpin the methodological and conceptual progress 
required in defining biodiversity targets, we actively participated 
in the Nature Target Setting Working Group of the UNEP FI 
Principles for Responsible Banking, which published its results in 
November 2023. We were able to take these results into 
immediate account we adopted a target on deforestation in 
December 2023 – a topic that plays a key role in preserving 
biodiversity. With this target in mind, we set concrete 
requirements for our customers in sectors and regions where this 
is a relevant issue to measure their commitment to combating 
deforestation (see section “Evaluating environmental and social 
risks”). 
In this non-financial report, we are guided by the requirements 
of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) 
for the first time. For future reports, we expect more 
comprehensive and detailed compliance with the requirements of 
the TNFD thanks to an improved data basis and methodological 
advances.

Reducing financed emissions 
We are pursuing the strategic goal of reducing 
the CO2 emissions of our entire loan and 
investment portfolio (referred to as “finance 
emissions”) to net zero by 2050. To get us to 
this target, we have identified CO2-intensive 
sectors in our portfolio and set concrete sector-specific reduction 
targets for these based on the SBTi methodology. The sectors 
currently classified as especially emissions-intensive are power 
generation, aviation, automotive manufacturing, commercial real 
estate financing, and the production of cement, iron and steel. We 
will likewise consider the retail mortgage financing portfolio, 
which is deemed optional in the SBTi analysis. This means that we 
take into account the most CO2-intensive elements of the supply 
chain, so it can be assumed that if these sectors are transformed, 
other parts of the portfolio will be transformed as well. 
Corresponding 2030 targets for reducing emission intensities were 
initially formulated for the specified portfolios and validated by the 
SBTi. This makes Commerzbank the first German bank with 
validated SBTi targets. Depending on SBTi methodology 
availability, we also aim to set portfolio-specific long-term goals 
(until 2050) in the next few years. 
 
 
 
As announced in September 2023, Commerzbank has joined the 
Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). 2023 also 
saw us switch our method of calculating portfolio intensities to the 
internationally recognised PCAF standard. In the course of 
applying this standard, we additionally recalculated the starting 
point in the kick-off year 2021 and determined new target values 
for 2030 (see chart for reduction targets based on the Sectoral 
Decarbonization Approach). The targets remained as ambitious as 
before, or became slightly more ambitious, because another sector 
(cement) moved from a 1.8°C pathway to a 1.5°C pathway. We still 
await final confirmation of the adjusted targets from the SBTi.  
Additionally, we have developed something we call the SBTi Net 
Zero Dashboard, which serves as a controlling instrument for the 
SBTi-relevant sectors. Our aim is to support companies in the real 
economy in their transformation process. We want to achieve 
sustainable reductions in financed emissions and steer our entire 
loan and investment portfolio towards our net zero target by 2050 
at the latest. 
As part of the SBTi framework, we apply two methods for our 
net zero target: first, the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach 
(SDA), a method for setting sector-specific intensity targets; and 
second, the temperature score, which financial institutions use to 
calculate the current “temperature score” of their portfolio based 
on their borrowers’ public emission reduction targets.  
The table below sets out the sector-specific CO2 reduction 
pathways that we have defined for the period to 2030. The 
percentage reductions derive from the applicable emission 
intensity for the baseline year 2021 and the targets for 2030. The 
emission intensities are calculated on the basis of transactions 
relevant to the balance sheet in both Commerzbank’s loan 
portfolio and its investment portfolio (Bank’s own banking book). 
The portfolio targets are published in our ESG framework where 
they, along with the status of target achievement, are updated on a 
regular basis. It is planned to publish the current reduction 
pathways for the temperature score portfolio together with the 
disclosure report.

1 Customers in the SDA sectors for which no emissions data is available are included in the temperature score. In doing so, we comply with the minimum coverage requirements of the SBTi. 
2 The specified CO2 reduction pathways represent the actual status at the end of each year, with 2021 considered the base year and 2030 the target year. 
3 The SDA target for aviation generally does not yet form part of the SBTi validation. This is because the SBTi’s aviation SDA methodology is currently still designed for the real 
economy and has not yet been approved for financial institutions. 
 
Achieving the SBTi reduction pathways presents a necessary 
challenge and a vital opportunity at the same time – something 
that Commerzbank would like to tackle together with its 
customers. In order to reduce sector-specific emission intensities, 
the customers in Commerzbank’s portfolio will need to make 
major transformation efforts themselves. Ultimately, however, the 
green transformation is a joint task for the entire real economy, 
financial system, politics and society.  
The SDA-relevant loan and investment portfolio consists of 
customers whose main activities can be attributed to the most 
CO2-intensive industrial sectors. The main drivers of sector-
specific emission intensities are the portfolio composition 
resulting from customers’ drawdown patterns (utilisations), and 
the CO2 emission intensities of the respective customers 
themselves. Since the variables mentioned are subject to certain 
fluctuations over time, the sector intensities shown also exhibit 
volatility in the same way.  
In the area of energy generation, the Commerzbank portfolio at 
the end of 2023 is performing much better than the target 
pathway. Of particular note here is the Bank’s strategic focus on 
project financing in the area of renewable energies. Commerzbank 
plans to expand this position further over the next few years. The 
emission intensity trend in the customer portfolio is also largely 
satisfactory in the automotive manufacturing, iron and steel 
sectors. 
Developments are challenging, especially in the cement sector 
as well as in the private and commercial real estate finance sector. 
The trend in the cement sector is primarily due to changes in the 
total lending of individual large corporate clients with a high CO2 
intensity in 2022, when no established SBTi management was in 
place, which could not be compensated for in 2023. In real estate 
financing – in contrast to other sectors – the extent to which a 
transformation can be implemented in the (very long-term) 
existing business is limited for legal reasons. It is to be expected 
that existing business will also improve thanks to increasing 
modernisation and the use of sustainable energy sources. 
However, the time horizon involved is very long-term and the 
process cannot be actively controlled by the Bank. The lever for 
transforming these portfolios lies much more in new business. The 
nationwide collapse in the real estate finance business (due in part 
 
 
 
 
 
 
54 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
to the extensive construction freezes on the back of market 
uncertainties and price increases) therefore had a negative impact 
on achieving targets in this sub-portfolio. Future developments 
here will be heavily dependent on a possible upswing in the new 
construction business as well as on the political and legal 
framework conditions supporting the transformation.  
We take the SBTi targets into account in our portfolio 
management. For the management of significant individual 
transactions 
in 
CO2-intensive 
sectors, 
we 
have 
therefore 
established a process for evaluating relevant exposures in relation 
to our strategic sustainability targets, including the net zero (SBTi) 
sector target pathways. The tools for SBTi portfolio management 
will be progressively expanded. In the 2023 reporting year, we 
defined general guidelines in a concept for managing and 
ensuring the achievement of SBTi targets for the Corporate 
Clients, Private and Small-Business Customers and Treasury 
business segments, which we will operationalise further in 2024. 
Incorporating EU taxonomy 
With the European Green Deal, which envisages greenhouse gas 
neutrality by 2050, the EU has set itself ambitious sustainability 
goals. The financial system can make a crucial contribution to 
transforming the economy by directing capital flows towards 
sustainable investments. As a uniform classification system, the 
EU Taxonomy Regulation is intended to support financial market 
participants in recognising sustainable economic activities by 
applying comparable criteria. It thus provides key guidance for the 
development of new green products and services and helps us 
assess the sustainability of businesses, partners and customers. As 
described in this report, the “klimaVest” impact fund and the 
Commerz Real Renewable Energies Fund II of Commerz Real, 
which is geared to professional and semi-professional investors, 
are for example, in line with the criteria of the EU Taxonomy. In 
addition, our sustainable transformation based on the EU 
Taxonomy criteria can increasingly be supported by differentiated 
pricing going forward. 
The activities included in the EU Taxonomy Regulation may be 
particularly relevant in terms of their impact on the climate and 
environment – both positive and negative. 
For the 2023 reporting year, transactions subject to the 
requirements of the EU Taxonomy need to be screened for 
alignment for the first time. This allows a statement to be made on 
whether the respective business can be described as sustainable 
within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy, i.e. whether it makes a 
positive contribution to one of the defined environmental 
objectives, does no significant harm to any of the other objectives, 
and complies with the minimum social safeguards.  
The scope of the report has been expanded compared to the 
previous two years, which significantly enhances transparency 
regarding the sustainability of business partners and their 
activities. 
Transactions that finance or invest in economic activities within 
the meaning of the EU Taxonomy, referred to as Taxonomy-
eligible transactions, must generally be screened for Taxonomy 
alignment. 
An economic activity is considered a “Taxonomy-eligible 
economic activity” if it is included in the delegated acts enacted 
according to Art. 10 (3), Art. 11 (3), Art. 12 (2), Art. 13 (2), Art. 14 
(2) and Art. 15 (2) of the Taxonomy Regulation. This applies 
regardless of whether this economic activity meets all the 
technical screening criteria set out in these delegated acts (cf. Art. 
1 No. 5 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 to Art. 8 of the 
Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852). 
An economic activity is considered a “Taxonomy-aligned 
economic activity” if it meets the requirements set out in Art. 3 of 
the Taxonomy Regulation (cf. Art. 1 No. 2 of the Delegated Act to 
Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation). This also includes compliance 
with the “technical screening criteria” set out in Art. 3 d). 
 
 
 
For banks, the scope of reporting is specified in Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2021/2178, which describes in particular the 
reporting tables and calculation methods for the individual key 
performance indicators (KPI) (Annexes V and VI). Where this does 
not provide clear specifications regarding the calculation method, 
we have made reasonable assumptions. 
Concerning the non-legally binding Draft Commission Notice3 
for the EU Taxonomy published at the end of December 2023, we 
performed a gap analysis from our previous interpretation based 
on the information available up to that point. In our opinion, the 
document contains various clarifications as well as new, expanded 
requirements. We have not taken the content into full account in 
the current reporting. For example, we currently do not pass on 
Taxonomy Quotas from parent companies required to publish a 
non-financial report (NFR) to subsidiaries. It has not yet been 
possible to determine a final implementation procedure due to the 
late publication date. We will evaluate this further in 2024.

The most important KPI for credit institutions is the green asset 
ratio (GAR), which specifies the ratio of relevant Taxonomy-
aligned assets to a bank’s total covered assets. The GAR relates to 
the material items within our assets, specifically the lending and 
investment 
business, 
including 
loans, 
bonds 
and 
equity 
instruments. 
In addition to the GAR, we are publishing the following 
performance indicators in this report for the first time (see the 
Notes, starting on page 93 ff.): 
 
• GAR (flow): indicates the inflow of new Taxonomy-aligned 
assets relative to the total covered assets. The inflow is clearly 
identified by the start date of a transaction, which is defined 
depending on the transaction type. For loans, the flow is the 
gross carrying amount of the new business active on the 
current reporting date and received in the reporting period. For 
securities, the flow corresponds to all securities received in the 
reporting period, regardless of whether the position still exists 
as at the current reporting date. 
• Financial Guarantees (FinGuar KPI): indicates the ratio of 
Taxonomy-aligned financial guarantees in relation to the total 
covered financial guarantees. 
• Assets under Management (AuM KPI): indicates the ratio of 
Taxonomy-aligned assets under management in relation to the 
total covered assets under management. 
 
The KPIs are determined twice because the disclosures by the 
companies (counterparties) are included in the calculations, and 
both turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs are available. 
We have not yet provided the flow size for AuM and financial 
guarantees (AuM KPI, FinGuar KPI) for the current reporting year 
because of unclear information regarding the calculation 
methodology. According to our interpretation, this cannot be 
determined until the next reporting date.  
Information on prior-year comparisons can generally only be 
provided on the next reporting date. As a result, the corresponding 
sections of the table are not filled in the Notes. They will be added 
in the next report. 
The EU taxonomy only covers certain parts of our business. 
Some transactions are completely excluded, for example the 
trading portfolio (until the 2026 financial year) and transactions 
with governments 4  or central banks. In addition, the GAR 
denominator includes portfolios that cannot be reported as 
Taxonomy-aligned, for example loans to SMEs.  
 
4 We also include transactions with regional governments. 
The populations of numerator and denominator therefore differ 
significantly from one another. 
 
 
 
The transactions that are relevant for the numerator are 
generally transactions with companies that are required to submit 
a non-financial report (NFR) in accordance with the Non-Financial 
Reporting Directive. In order to identify these companies, we used 
data from an external data provider on companies required to 
publish a non-financial report, which we combined with our 
customer information. Certain transactions with households and 
local authorities are also taken into account. In the case of special 
financing for special purpose vehicles (SPV’s) that are not 
regularly required to submit a non-financial report, we applied a 
‘look through’ approach. Here, we consider the use of proceeds to 
be most important and are including this accordingly in the 
reporting. 
Two procedures are used to screen our risk positions for 
Taxonomy eligibility or Taxonomy alignment. A distinction is made 
based on whether the use of the proceeds by the borrower/issuer 
is unknown (general-purpose loans and securities) or known 
(loans with a purpose). 
General-purpose loans and securities are weighted using the 
turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs of the borrower/issuer and 
are thus included in the calculation of the GAR in the two 
calculation variants. 
The calculation of the GAR and AuM KPIs includes equities 
with the issuer’s turnover-based or CapEx-based KPIs as well as 
certain funds (according to Art. 8 and Art. 9 of the Sustainable 
Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)) with the product-specific 
KPI. We do not carry out a ‘look through’ for other funds. For 
bonds where the issue proceeds were allocated to a specific 
sustainable purpose, the issuers have not yet provided product-
specific KPIs whose calculation methodology meets the Taxonomy 
requirements. Until the newly enacted EU Green Bond Standard is 
applicable and product-specific taxonomy quotas are available, all 
bonds will be assessed using the issuer’s turnover-based and 
CapEx-based KPIs. 
We assess general purpose loans and securities on the basis of 
external data relating to our counterparties’ KPIs. The information 
provided by the data providers refers to the companies’ 
disclosures for the 2022 reporting year. If no information was 
available, we assessed these positions as Taxonomy-non-eligible 
or Taxonomy-non-aligned.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Risk positions towards relevant subsidiaries of companies 
required to publish a non-financial report are generally assessed 
based on the subsidiary’s disclosed KPIs. If no KPIs are available 
at subsidiary level, we assess these risk positions as Taxonomy-
non-eligible or Taxonomy-non-aligned. 
When screening loans where the use of proceeds is known, the 
assessment is based on the information provided by the borrower 
about the activities for which the proceeds are used. If the use of 
funds (financed economic activity) is described in the Taxonomy 
Regulation, we assess these loans as Taxonomy-eligible. 
In order to determine whether a transaction can be classified as 
Taxonomy-aligned, we examine the comprehensive technical 
screening criteria, which differ depending on the economic 
activity. A check is also carried out to determine that none of the 
other objectives are significantly harmed and that the criteria for 
social minimum safeguards are met. 
We have established appropriate procedures to assess 
Taxonomy eligibility and Taxonomy alignment. We rolled out 
software solutions in 2023 that allow us to implement (partially) 
automated processes when screening for Taxonomy alignment, 
making the process more streamlined and efficient. 
We generally assess Taxonomy alignment for Taxonomy-
eligible transactions that are essential to our business activities 
and, where necessary, introduce new processes to collect relevant 
information about our customers. 
In cases where we did not have access to the required 
information and evidence (for checking the technical screening 
criteria) and this could not be ascertained with reasonable effort, 
we classified these items as Taxonomy-non-aligned. 
The KPIs were calculated using the Bank’s central data 
warehouse, which also forms the basis for the financial reporting. 
The mBank data were collected locally and then integrated into 
the Group figures. The calculation was based on gross carrying 
amounts. 
The green asset ratio in the reporting period is as follows:

Our Taxonomy-aligned volume and thus the green asset ratio is 
characterised by retail mortgage financing and special financing 
for SPV’s in the field of renewable energies in the European 
Economic Area. 
The current reporting of Taxonomy-aligned volume relates to 
environmental objectives 1 and 2. Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2023/2486 of 27 June 2023 supplements the EU Taxonomy with 
technical screening criteria for four additional environmental 
objectives.

With respect to the four additional environmental objectives, 
financial firms will initially only have to provide information 
regarding Taxonomy eligibility from the 2023 reporting year 
onwards. The full reporting requirements for Taxonomy alignment 
will apply starting from the 2025 reporting year. 
Taxonomy-eligible activities must be assigned to one – 
specifically– the most relevant – environmental objective. Double 
counting is not permitted. The Taxonomy eligibility of loans where 
the use of proceeds is known was screened for all six 
environmental objectives. The loans were consequently assigned to 
the first environmental objective (climate change mitigation). There 
was no remaining amount that could be allocated to other 
environmental objectives. For general-purpose loans and securities, 
we only had company KPIs for the first environmental objective –
climate change mitigation – and, to a limited extent, also for the 
second environmental objective – climate change adaptation. 
Accordingly, the columns in the templates for data on 
environmental objectives three to six are empty and have been 
hidden by us in this report. 
The extension of the EU taxonomy to include nuclear and gas 
entered into force on 1 January 2023, so the corresponding 
company data will be included in this report for the first time (for 
general-purpose loans and securities). The financed economic 
activities in the nuclear and gas sector are part of the green asset 
ratio (stock). In addition, we are required to report the shares in 
the GAR (stock) in separate templates in the Notes. We have not 
identified any loans where the use of proceeds is known in the 
nuclear and gas sector. 
Commerzbank’s own understanding of sustainability in these 
activities is described in greater detail in the ESG framework. We 
have a principle of not financing any new nuclear power plants. The 
same is true for uranium mines. We have strict requirements for 
transactions involving fossil fuels and generally take a critical view of 
these transactions. At the same time, we see the need for gas as a 
transition technology over the coming years to ensure continued 
stability of supply. We therefore critically scrutinise financing for the 
construction of gas-fired power plants on a case-by-case basis.  
Managing environmental risks 
Commerz-
bank 
defines 
environ-
mental 
risks as both climate-related and biodiversity risks. 
Comprehensive assessment of climate-related risks 
At Commerzbank, we do not consider climate-related risks as a 
separate type of risk, but as a horizontal risk. This can materialise 
across the different known types of risk such as credit risk or 
market risk. In 2023, we carried out another comprehensive 
materiality analysis for environmental risks across all risk types for 
the Commerzbank Group as part of the annual risk inventory 
process, taking into account the requirements of the European 
Central Bank’s “Guide on climate-related and environmental 
risks”. In this process, all risk types assessed as material in the 
risk inventory were evaluated in terms of factors such as their 
materiality in relation to climate-related risks. Both transition and 
physical risks were considered and a materiality assessment was 
carried out in each case. This classification into materially affected 
and non-materially-affected risk types is based on both a time 
dimension and a risk type-specific dimension.  
 
 
 
The time dimension is divided into short, medium and long-
term time horizons. For each specified time horizon, an 
assessment is first carried out for climate-related and biodiversity 
risks, which can then be further divided into physical and 
transition risks. The materiality threshold on which this 
classification is based is consistent with the established risk 
thresholds from the risk inventory for all risk types. Materiality for 
each risk type is determined on a scenario basis and, where 
possible and appropriate, also on a quantitative basis. This 
provides the foundation for ensuring holistic consideration of the 
effects resulting from the risk types materially affected by 
environmental risks as part of Commerzbank’s ICAAP. A 
comprehensive qualitative analysis of possible transmission 
channels 
is 
carried 
out, 
and 
in 
general 
scenario-based 
quantification is added. The climate scenarios used include those 
formulated by the Network for Greening the Financial System 
(NGFS). The internally established scenario analysis and stress 
testing infrastructure are used for this purpose. 
Transition risks arise for companies as a result of the transition 
to a lower-emission and more sustainable economic system (e.g. 
owing to regulatory or legal changes in energy policy, changes in 
market sentiment and preferences, technological innovations or 
greenwashing risks). Physical risks, by contrast, arise as a result of 
changing climatic conditions and the associated more extreme and 
more frequent acute weather events, such as floods or heatwaves, 
or chronic effects, such as rising sea levels.  
As a result of the analysis, the influence of climate-related risks 
for the risk types credit risk, market risk, operational risk 
(including compliance and cyber risk), reputational risk and 
business risk was confirmed as material. No materiality was 
established for property value risks, liquidity risks and model risks. 
A risk type is considered to be materially influenced by climate-
related risks as soon as it is materially affected by either transition

1 The short-term time horizon is up to one year, the medium-term time horizon two to 
five years, and the long-term time horizon more than five years (at least ten years were 
considered). 
 
The findings of the materiality analysis feed into business strategy, 
the overall risk strategy and the sub-risk strategies as well as into 
other core elements of the Bank’s internal process to ensure an 
adequate capital position, such as the internal stress test 
framework and the risk-bearing capacity concept. Particularly in 
the case of risk types materially affected by climate-related risks, 
environmental risks are managed within the risk function 
responsible for the respective risk type. The materiality analysis 
for climate-related risks is an integral part of the Commerzbank 
Group’s risk governance. In addition to the annual materiality 
analysis, we carry out internal climate stress tests too. 
As a financial institution of the German economy, we are also 
active in sectors that are particularly exposed to climate-related 
physical or transition risks. However, we have little exposure to 
some of the hardest-hit sectors (agriculture, for example). Sectors 
that could potentially be more heavily affected by climate-related 
risks and that have larger exposures are, for example, the energy 
sector, the automotive sector and mechanical engineering, as well 
as (commercial) real estate finance.  
Owing to the geographical focus of our portfolio in Germany 
and Europe, we are comparatively less affected by physical 
climate-related risks, such as hurricanes and rising sea levels. The 
materiality analysis shows that both transition and physical 
climate-related risks are material to credit risk over a long-term 
time horizon. 
Reputational risk is one of the Commerzbank Group’s main 
non-quantifiable risk types (see “Evaluating environmental and 
social risks”). Reputational risks were classified within the 
materiality analysis as material overall, particularly due to 
greenwashing risks. Quantitative effects were evaluated using 
bank-specific and risk-type-specific scenarios, including expert 
estimates. Reputational risk is now considered within the context 
of environmental risk as part of regular central risk reporting. 
Additional appropriate control measures have been implemented, 
such as a greenwashing risk internal control framework and the 
screening of new sustainable products to identify greenwashing. 
Detailed reporting on the risk types is published online in the 
ESG appendix of the disclosure report. 
Taking climate-related risks into account in lending  
In order to manage the effects of climate-related risks in 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s lending business, we are 
systematically optimising our processes and methods. We must 
understand and actively manage the associated risks, not least in 
connection 
with 
our 
strategy, 
in 
order 
to 
support 
the 
transformation of companies to a more environmentally friendly 
and climate-neutral economy. We combine specific findings from 
scenario analyses (including sector- or country-specific effects of 
climate-related risks) with an individual risk analysis at customer 
level.  
 
 
 
The findings from the scenario and credit risk analyses are 
aggregated in a structured assessment (“score”). We factor this 
score into the individual loan decision. Depending on the score, 
increased requirements or restrictions are triggered on a portfolio-
specific basis. We also use the score as part of our portfolio 
analysis and management. Portfolio-specific guidelines, which are 
anchored in the credit risk strategy, limit the share of loans with 
heightened climate-related risk. These processes and procedures 
are mandatory components and incorporated in full into the credit 
risk analysis.  
We take a portfolio-specific approach and thus take appropriate 
account of the differences in terms of those affected and the 
risk drivers.  
 
 
We are continually updating our processes and methods to 
manage the effects of climate-related risks

In the particularly relevant portfolios such as corporate clients, 
special financing, banks and commercial real estate finance, we 
have supplemented the qualitative risk analysis in the individual 
loan decisions with these specific aspects for the analysis of 
climate-related risks. We will progressively extend this approach 
to other portfolios and include smaller companies, for example. In 
our target state, we want to integrate climate-related risks – as far 
as possible – into the quantitative credit risk analysis and thus fully 
reflect them across the process, including in pricing and reporting. 
Another key aspect is adding continuously to our specialists’ 
expertise in climate-related risk, which enables us to discuss the 
challenges and work together with our customers to assess the 
risks on an equal footing. We deepen this know-how with the 
support of external consultants, academia and various initiatives. 
Climate-related risks – both physical and transition risks – also 
play a major role in Commerz Real’s asset management. The Bank 
uses 
future 
scenarios 
based 
on 
the 
representative 
CO2 
concentration pathways set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change to accurately determine the exposure of assets 
and the portfolio. In its risk assessment, including scenario 
analyses, Commerz Real relies on tools such as the Carbon Risk 
Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) and the Climate Excellence Tool. 
The CRREM tool shows climate pathways using asset class and 
country-specific CO2 and final energy target values for a 1.5° and a 
2.0° scenario. The Climate Excellence Tool, on the other hand, 
allows for a site-specific evaluation of physical climate-related 
risks for different scenarios.  
In this way, Commerz Real tries to perform a risk analysis that 
is as accurate as possible for the location on the basis of existing 
data and to derive specific measures to prevent damage at an early 
stage. The results feed into the risk assessment and the 
sustainability assessment of all real estate transactions and are 
taken into account accordingly in the management phase. The 
basis of climate risk management is collecting all consumption 
and emissions data and location data in a way that is as reliable as 
possible. To this end, Commerz Real has implemented a 
sustainability data management system and also uses external 
partners to collect data on a global level. 
Understanding biodiversity risks 
Commerzbank 
considers 
both 
climate-related 
risks 
and 
biodiversity risks. These are also regarded as horizontal risks for 
the Bank. As with climate-related risks, the classification of 
biodiversity risk for material risk types is a central component of 
the annual materiality analysis. Following the initial 2022 report, 
the scope of the analyses and methodology were expanded and 
improved in the year under review. The expert-based assessment 
of biodiversity risks and their impact within the Bank includes a 
driver and transmission channel analysis, which in the year under 
review was also supported by the first qualitative consideration of 
biodiversity-related scenario narratives. The two narratives 
considered each had a physical and/or transition risk focus. 
Physical biodiversity risks arise from a loss or degradation of 
things provided by the ecosystem which are vital to the economic 
system (e.g. availability of water, pollination or genetic diversity). 
Transition risks, on the other hand, describe risks that arise as a 
result of the transformation process towards a more sustainable 
and environmentally friendly economy. Such risks could arise if 
the water price increases significantly for a company with high 
water consumption (for example, due to regulatory requirements). 
To summarise, credit risk, reputational risk and business risk 
are materially affected by biodiversity risks. The focus here is 
primarily on medium- and long-term transition risks.

Analysis of biodiversity risk in credit risk 
The physical risk analysis for credit risk focuses on assessing the 
extent to which sectors in which Commerzbank is represented 
through credit exposures are dependent on the things provided by 
the ecosystem. The risk assessment additionally incorporated 
external data from ENCORE, which classifies each sector’s degree 
of dependency. The data concerning dependence of an economic 
activity on the things provided by the ecosystem was considered 
together with the business volume in the respective sector. The 
materiality analysis revealed that some sectors are more 
dependent on things provided by the ecosystem, such as 
wholesale and the chemicals and food sectors. Overall, around 
10% of the portfolio has a high dependency and around 29% has 
a medium dependency on things provided by the ecosystem. The 
biggest driver of physical biodiversity risks is dependence on 
water. A more in-depth analysis based on the approach to climate-
related risks is planned for the future, supported by appropriate 
scenarios – where available – and more advanced assessment 
methods.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
In the case of transition biodiversity risks for credit risk, the 
assessment included the adverse impact of business activities on 
the environment and the potential consequences resulting from 
anticipated future regulatory changes to protect biodiversity. 
According to the assessment, high transition risk exists if both the 
adverse impact and the foreseeable regulatory changes are 
classified as likely. Commerzbank identified the chemicals and 
beverages sector as well as the extraction of crude oil and natural 
gas as high transition risk sectors for the Bank. Overall, 4% of the 
portfolio was rated as having a high transition risk, and 24% a 
medium transition risk.  
With respect to credit risk, physical biodiversity risks are more 
relevant than transition risks as few concrete transformation 
processes are discernible at the present time. 
Biodiversity risks also play an important role at Commerz Real. 
This applies especially to our fund products, which meet the 
transparency obligations under Article 8 or Article 9 of the EU 
Disclosure Regulation and aim for or intend to ensure a minimum 
proportion of Taxonomy-aligned investments. For example, in the 
case of “klimaVest” and the Commerz Real Renewable Energies 
Fund II, which was issued for professional and semi-professional 
investors, impact and ESG due diligence is carried out as part of 
the purchasing process for every potential investment. Any 
adverse impacts on biodiversity are examined and evaluated 
alongside the other environmental targets of the EU Taxonomy. 
The funds strive to ensure that their investments do not go to wind 
or solar plants built in protected areas and that these plants do not 
have a significant adverse impact on local biodiversity. 
4. Supporting the customer 
transformation 
 
Combating climate change and the loss of biodiversity requires not 
only favourable political conditions and new technical solutions, 
but above all adequate financial resources. This poses numerous 
opportunities for us as a bank. The energy revolution and 
reduction in CO2 emissions are creating a need for new 
technologies and products requiring large investments. At the 
same time, our customers are facing new types of non-financial 
challenges: from collecting data and managing their own carbon 
footprints to making decisions on their technological direction in 
the context of the energy transition. In addition, interest in 
sustainable investment opportunities is growing, which is why we 
are developing products and services that take account of these 
changes while offering an environmental or social benefit.  
We provide our customers with expert advice on transforming 
their business models. We align our offering with their interests, 
evaluate our business success in part based on their satisfaction, 
and incorporate sustainability into our dialogue formats. Ensuring 
data security also makes a significant contribution to customer 
satisfaction. We continuously check this level of satisfaction and 
ensure that we involve our customers at the appropriate points. 
Sustainable financing 
We develop sustainable products with market analyses, the Bank’s 
own technical and product expertise and regulatory requirements 
in mind. These products support our customers in their 
sustainable transformation and at the same time provide 
incentives for companies and private individuals to become more 
sustainable. We draw on classic product development practices, 
agile methods and direct dialogue with customers. The products 
prioritised for development are determined in equal measure by 
the requirements of the Bank’s own sustainability strategy, 
customer 
needs, 
economic 
considerations 
and 
regulatory 
requirements.  
When integrating ESG aspects into our products, services and 
consulting processes, in the future we will focus not only on the 
climate, but also on other topic areas identified in the materiality 
analysis, such as environmental protection and biodiversity. In the 
Corporate Clients segment, we rely on risk and sales data to 
evaluate the ESG dimensions of our portfolio. These offer 
sustainable business opportunities and at the same time allow us 
to provide advisory services and financing products to support our 
customers in their own transformations. The sales and lending 
departments work closely together to address the specifics of ESG 
issues. mBank also reviews and evaluates new products in terms 
of their impact on the environment and society (including 
customers). This encompasses sustainability aspects such as 
greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, waste and the 
circular economy, and equal access to financial services.

Promoting renewable energy  
Commerzbank 
Aktien-
gesellschaft has long, wide-
ranging 
experience 
with 
renewable energy. Corporate 
and project financing along 
the value chain have been 
part of our portfolio since 
the 1980s and will continue 
to be a growth area for us in 
the 
future. 
The 
core 
business of the Centre of Competence Energy (CoC Energy), which 
has sites in Hamburg and New York, is the global provision of 
finance to wind and solar parks as well as related technology. The 
plants that are financed are operated in particular by independent 
power producers, project developers, institutional investors and 
utilities. 
 
 
 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is currently one of the largest 
financiers of renewable energy in Europe and further expanded its 
international portfolio share in the year under review. 2023 once 
again saw us realise financing for wind farms and solar parks as 
well as add new projects and refinancing transactions in Europe 
and the USA. One of the flagship projects in the year under review 
was the Boitzenburger Land solar park. We are the sole financing 
partner for this project, which has a volume of €100m. The solar 
park supplies around 65,000 households with green electricity 
every year. CoC Energy’s total financing commitment in 2023 was 
around €9bn. 
 
 
 
As part of its 2021–2025 business strategy, mBank has committed 
to mobilising approximately €2.1bn (10bn Polish zloty) to finance 
green investments, particularly in renewable energy sources.  
At the end of 2023, mBank’s total renewable energy portfolio 
had a value of €909m (3.98bn Polish zloty). In 2023 alone, mBank 
provided around €261m (1.15bn Polish zloty) for seven 
photovoltaic projects, two wind farm projects and two hybrid 
projects comprising photovoltaic and wind farm investments. In 
addition to financing large-scale projects, mBank offers financial 
support for smaller renewable energy projects with a rated output 
of up to 5 megawatts. 
Commerz Real contributes directly to shaping the energy 
revolution by investing in renewable energy. It also sources 
electricity from renewable sources for the properties held by its 
funds and special funds, where local markets permit. 
Demonstrating sustainable finance solutions 
Commerz-
bank 
Aktien-
gesellschaft 
offers 
corporate customers sustainable bilateral credit products (green 
loans) used to fund sustainability-related projects. Corporate 
financing can also take the form of KPI-linked loans and ESG 
rating-linked loans, where the conditions are based on the extent 
of the company’s transformation efforts. Indicators for this include 
individually agreed key figures, some of which are externally 
validated, such as reductions in CO2 emissions. Another 
measurement parameter is the sustainability rating, which shows a 
company’s 
sustainability 
efforts 
in 
comparison 
to 
sector 
performance. The Bank is also working on expanding its financing 
offering with sustainability components.  
We are additionally incorporating sustainability considerations 
into the development of traditional financing solutions. We advise 
businesses about the advantages of public promotional loans such 
as KfW’s energy efficiency programmes or its climate protection 
initiative for small and medium-sized enterprises. We keep an eye 
on new products and product evolutions from the public funding 
bodies and offer these to our customers.  
In the Private and Small-Business Customers segment, the 
offering includes financing for energy-efficient buildings. The 
green mortgage loans scheme, for example, offers preferential 
financing conditions for the construction, modernisation or 
acquisition of buildings – for own or third-party use – whose 
energy value does not exceed 50kWh per square metre of usable 
floor space.  
This applies equally to all multi-dwellings as well as residential 
and commercial buildings where the share of income from 
commercial rent is less than one third. The green “KlimaDarlehen”, 
an individual loan for self-employed people and small businesses 
(formerly “green CBU”), also finances sustainable commercial 
investments. Examples of these include heat or electricity 
generation from sustainable, renewable sources and investments in

electric and hydrogen mobility. The intended uses of these projects 
meet the definition of environmentally sustainable activities under 
the ESG framework, meaning that the financing goes towards 
climate protection or climate adaptation activities. 
Responsibility in the lending business for the Private 
Customers segment also takes account of potential changes in a 
customer’s economic situation. This also includes identifying 
customers with signs of financial problems early on – and thus 
before the emergence of problems threatening their existence, if 
possible – and suggesting measures to be taken which will, ideally, 
lead to an orderly repayment process. 
Sustainable investments and capital market 
products 
In the investment business, too, we want to contribute to 
sustainable development and take advantage of the associated 
business opportunities, for example by offering sustainable funds, 
integrating sustainability matters into asset management and 
using sustainable capital market instruments. We also take our 
customers’ sustainability preferences into consideration as 
standard when giving investment advice. 
Developing sustainable bonds and loans  
In 2007, we were involved in 
issuing 
the 
world’s 
first 
green bond. Since then, we 
have 
supported 
a 
large 
number 
of 
companies 
in 
preparing and issuing sustainable bonds. In the 2023 reporting 
year alone, Commerzbank acted as lead manager for the issue of 
76 sustainable bonds with a total volume of €61bn (2022: 
€46.6bn), an increase of more than 30% year on year. This 
volume is included in the sustainable business volume in 
accordance with the criteria set out in the ESG framework. 
 
 
 
The transactions supported in 2023 again included a number of 
issues from companies that for the first time linked their capital 
market transactions with their sustainability strategy. In addition, 
Commerzbank supported a growing number of green and social 
bonds in Swiss francs in 2023 with a volume of more than CHF 
1bn. Through our involvement in various interest groups and 
professional associations, such as the ICMA Green Bond Principles 
and the Climate Bonds Initiative, we also make a contribution to 
furthering the development of the market for sustainable bonds. In 
total, the Bank has already assisted in the issue of more than 280 
sustainable bonds.  
In 
addition, 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft 
arranges, 
structures and places sustainable promissory note loans and 
syndicated loans, particularly in the form of ESG-linked loans, for 
corporate customers of varying sizes across a wide range of 
sectors. In these transactions, we regularly act as sustainability 
coordinator in order to develop ambitious ESG structures, working 
on behalf of the banking consortium in close consultation with the 
companies. ESG-linked loans are a comparatively new but very 
fast-growing product category, and now represent the most 
common form of sustainable syndicated loans. The terms of the 
loans are linked to sustainability criteria, predominantly in the 
form of sustainability-related KPIs or a borrower ESG rating. If the 
borrower meets the predefined targets for these KPIs or the 
underlying rating, the interest rate is lower – with higher interest 
rates applying if they are not met. Sustainable promissory note 
loans operate in essentially the same way. Since 2017, we have 
been participating in working groups of the Loan Market 
Association to actively shape the implementation of sustainability 
in the syndicated loan market. 
Due to the challenging market environment, Commerzbank 
only just missed the targets it set for itself for concluding new 
sustainable loans and promissory note loans with a volume of 
€75bn in 2023. This also includes 65 sustainable syndicated loans 
and promissory note loans for companies at the global level with a 
total transaction volume 
of €74.7bn (Commerzbank loan 
commitments of around 6%). Syndicated loans accounted for the 
major part of the volume.  
 
 
 
Sustainability aspects are also playing an increasingly 
important role in the Bank’s own investments. As part of its 
liquidity management activities, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft 
is increasingly investing in sustainable bonds and building up its 
own ESG portfolio. To this end, the Bank plans to invest an 
increasing proportion of its own assets in green, social and 
sustainability bonds.  
By the end of 2023, their volume within the liquidity portfolio 
had reached around €3.1bn. Commerzbank takes sustainability 
aspects into account in its company pension scheme in Germany, 
with asset managers only selected for the pension plan if they 
have signed the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).

Managing customers’ money sustainably 
As 
a 
signatory 
to the UN

the 
Asset 
Management 
unit 
at 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft 
is 
committed to incorporating sustainability aspects into its analysis 
and decision-making processes and making an active contribution 
to responsible investment decisions. Asset Management therefore 
offers wealthy individuals as well as corporate and small-business 
customers various solutions that take environmental and social 
factors into consideration. In particular, customers can agree on 
individual sustainable asset management in which the security 
selection not only takes exclusion criteria and sustainability 
ratings into account, but also aims to invest in companies with 
sustainable business activities. In 2023, “Vermögensverwaltung 
Nachhaltigkeit” (Sustainable Asset Management) celebrated its 
10th anniversary. The overall picture shows that the integration of 
ESG criteria does not engender any systematic disadvantages for 
performance and improves risk management. 
Overall, the proportion of sustainable investments, which under 
the ESG framework feed into the sustainable business volume, has 
increased significantly in recent years and as at the end of 2023 
accounted for 12.5% of Commerzbank Asset Management’s AuM. 
The digital and sustainable asset management offering 
“cominvest green” from the Commerzbank brand comdirect gives 
customers the choice between a wide range of exchange-traded 
funds (ETFs) that reduce adverse effects in terms of ESG. In 
addition, the motif investing product allows customers to make 
targeted investments in megatrends without advice. The funds, 
ETFs and equities are sorted into themes such as robotics, health, 
technology and sustainability, which customers can then use to 
compile their portfolio. These products are also available to select 
for other investment formats such as savings plans. 
With the acquisition of a majority stake in Aquila Capital 
Investmentgesellschaft at the beginning of 2024, Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft is expanding its range of offerings for 
customers in sustainable asset management. The investment 
company specialises in essential real asset investments such as 
renewable energies and sustainable infrastructure projects. The 
transaction is still subject to the necessary regulatory approvals 
but is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 
2024. 
mBank is also active in this segment, and private customers 
can now invest in ETF-based equity and bond portfolios that 
promote environmental and social aspects. Two of the seven 
model portfolios offered by mBank currently meet these 
requirements, with an expansion planned for the future. The value 
of assets invested in ESG asset management strategies for private 
customers at end-2023 was virtually unchanged year on year at 
€34m (151m Polish zloty). The share of these ESG investment 
strategies of the total volume in the model portfolios of this 
customer group was 32%, thus remaining on a comparable level 
with the previous year.  
Commerz Real combines sustainable investment opportunities 
with a direct contribution to shaping the energy revolution: 
Numerous investments have followed since the first investments 
were made in solar energy via funds back in 2005. The portfolio 
has also been expanded to include onshore and offshore wind 
turbines. The Commerz Real Group holds stakes in 55 ground-
mounted solar parks and 41 onshore/offshore wind farms with an 
annual total rated output of around 1,573 megawatts, making it 
one of the largest German asset managers in this segment today. A 
further 511 megawatts of total rated output can be realised by 
2028 through the completion of six previously acquired solar park 
development projects. The assets under management in renewable 
energy stood at around €3.3bn at the end of 2023.  
In 2020, Commerz Real launched “klimaVest”, the first open-
ended real asset fund in the renewable energy sector aimed at 
private investors, with redemption rights in the form of a European 
Long-Term Investment Fund (ELTIF). Since 2021, the fund has met 
the transparency requirements to qualify as a sustainable financial 
product under Article 9 of the EU Disclosure Regulation. 
“klimaVest” invests mainly in facilities for the generation of 
renewable energy and in the infrastructure of the energy 
revolution. The fund’s investment objective is to generate risk-
adjusted returns for investors while making a positive contribution 
to the achievement of environmentally sustainable objectives 
within the meaning of the EU taxonomy and in accordance with 
the Paris Agreement. “klimaVest”’s volume stood at around 
€1.3bn as at the end of 2023. 
For professional and semi-professional investors, the Commerz 
Real Renewable Energies Fund II combines the topics of 
sustainability and returns in the form of an impact fund. In 
pursuing its investment objective, it strives to help limit global 
warming in the long term in line with the climate protection goals 
outlined in the Paris Agreement. By investing in environmentally 
sustainable renewable energy systems such as wind farms and 
photovoltaic 
systems, 
the 
fund 
promotes 
the 
energy 
transformation by ensuring or increasing the proportion of green 
electricity in the power grid. The fund also complies with the 
transparency requirements set out in Article 9 of the EU 
Disclosure Regulation. 
In addition, Commerz Real sets great store by sustainability in 
managing its real estate assets, such as with hausInvest. With 
€17.3bn in assets at the end of 2023, the fund is one of the largest 
open-ended real estate funds in Europe. In 2021, it became one of 
the first open-ended real estate funds to promote environmental 
and/or social objectives pursuant to Article 8 of the Disclosure 
Regulation. The fund has expanded its investment strategy 
accordingly. The aim is to reduce the portfolio’s CO2 footprint to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
64 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
14 kilogrammes per square meter by 2050. In 2022, hausInvest 
decided to meet the requirement level for environmentally 
sustainable investments under the EU taxonomy and the minimum 
requirements for sustainable investments for the purposes of the 
EU Disclosure Regulation. The taxonomy states that their 
minimum share is 5% of the fair value of the real estate belonging 
to the special fund. In determining the fair value mentioned above, 
project developments are included from the time of their 
completion and properties held by real estate companies are 
included in proportion to their ownership interest. 
Since May 2023, the Smart Living Europe Fund has been the 
first institutional real estate fund from Commerz Real to meet the 
transparency requirements in accordance with Article 8 of the EU 
Disclosure Regulation. To this end, a minimum share of 10% 
(measured by the market value of the real estate held in the 
portfolio) is maintained in sustainable investments in accordance 
with Article 3 of the EU Taxonomy. 
Trading or offsetting emissions  
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is a participant in the European 
Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and the UK Emissions 
Trading Scheme (UK ETS). It advises companies on the 
procurement of carbon emissions rights and on the associated risk 
management aspects, and helps to implement the resulting trading 
strategies. In addition, there is the option of voluntarily offsetting a 
company’s unavoidable carbon emissions with certificates from 
emission reduction projects. As a member of the World Bank’s 
Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, the Bank also participates in 
the global debate on carbon pricing. In equipment leasing, 
Commerz Real has incorporated the topic of sustainability into its 
business via its subsidiary Commerz Real Mobilienleasing (CRML). 
CRML’s PRO Climate Lease also offers the option, in parallel with 
the financing business, to support projects aimed at avoiding or 
absorbing CO2 emissions via individual CO2 offsets. 
Ensuring data security 
The protection of customer data and compliance with banking 
secrecy requirements are of the utmost importance in this era of 
increasing digitalisation. They are fundamental to the satisfaction 
of our customers and to trust within a long-term business 
relationship. That is why data security is a key issue for us in 
terms of responsible banking. 
Responding to cyber crime 
With the increasing digital networking of state, business and 
society, cyber security and cyber resilience are becoming more 
and more important. Commerzbank scrutinises not only its own 
information, premises and IT systems, but also those of its 
customers and service providers, including any independent 
transport routes. Cyber security is a driver of customer confidence 
and thus an important competitive factor. With that in mind, it is 
crucial to ensuring the security of our systems. As part of the 
critical infrastructure, the financial industry is subject to enhanced 
legal requirements.  
 
 
 
We want to adequately address both this trend and future 
challenges relating to the management of cyber risks. Cyber and 
information security risks are managed by the Group division 
Group Risk Management – Cyber Risk & Information Security 
(GRM-CRIS), which reports to the Group Chief Information 
Security Officer. In addition to established security functions such 
as the ISO 27001 certified Information Security Management 
System, the focus is on managing cyber risk appropriately and on 
strengthening Commerzbank’s cyber resilience. To cover the 
human element, we also rely on our employees being highly 
security and risk-conscious. We promote this via a special, multi-
award-winning information security awareness campaign. GRM-
CRIS also addresses the interplay between cyber and information 
security risks and other types of risk relating to areas such as HR, 
procurement, business continuity management (BCM) and 
physical security. 
mBank also attaches great importance to the security of its IT 
systems 
and 
the 
data 
they 
contain, 
deploying 
suitable 
organisational and technical solutions. Every employee of mBank 
in Poland is required to complete cyber security training once a 
year. The Bank’s security department also includes a 24-hour 
security operations centre (SOC).

Ensuring data protection  
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft takes the protection of personal 
data very seriously and complies with the applicable data 
protection rules, in particular the provisions of the EU General 
Data Protection Regulation and the Group Data Protection Policy. 
The purpose of this policy is to ensure a consistently high level of 
data protection in the Group and to respect the fundamental rights 
and freedoms of data subjects. It includes principles applicable 
Group-wide for the collection, processing, use and international 
transmission of personal data. 
Making sparing, proportionate, necessary use of personal data 
only within the legally permissible limits is a right under the 
Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, to which 
Commerzbank is expressly committed. This also includes 
processing only for a specific purpose and ensuring transparency 
towards and the provision of information to the data subject. 
Commerzbank also transfers personal data to third parties only if 
this is lawful and it is not apparent that there is a risk to the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject; this includes 
transfers of personal data to authorities. Personal data is deleted 
as soon as it is no longer required for business purposes and there 
is no other legitimate reason preventing deletion. We can 
demonstrate that we comply with the principles governing the 
processing of personal data. 
Commerzbank investigates inquiries, complaints, requests for 
information and breaches of personal data protection without 
delay and keeps in close communication with the data subject, 
especially when there may be risks to their fundamental rights and 
freedoms. In addition, data subjects can contact Commerzbank’s 
data protection officer at any time. To raise our employees’ 
awareness of data privacy and data security issues and keep them 
informed, there are regular training sessions and mandatory 
educational programmes. 
Commerz Real has a central data protection officer and data 
protection coordinators in the departments. In Poland, mBank’s 
data protection officer and the associated team support the Bank’s 
business units, based on the Personal Data Security Policy and the 
Policy for Personal Data Management over Time.  
Given that the Bank has almost 11 million private and small-
business customers in Germany and around 5.8 million private 
and small-business customers in Poland, the Czech Republic and 
Slovakia, plus around 25,500 corporate client groups worldwide, 
the number of data protection complaints was again comparatively 
low in 2023. For example, the data protection officer of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft in Germany received 221 
customer complaints by the end of the year under review. In most 
cases, the complaint was that data had been put to unauthorised 
use or had become known to third parties. 
Using big data responsibly 
Efficient and holistic data processing offers great opportunities for 
all segments and Group divisions: as a basis for decision-making 
in the management of operational processes, for more detailed 
and faster analysis, and for improved service and cross-selling. At 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, responsibility for this area lies 
with the Big Data and Advanced Analytics (BDAA) Group unit. As a 
centre of competence for machine learning (ML) and artificial 
intelligence (AI), BDAA is also responsible for the Group’s AI 
strategy, in particular the further development of AI governance 
within the framework of the three lines of defence, as well as the 
establishment and provision of basic AI functionality and selected 
use cases.  
 
 
 
AI governance furthermore involves the employer side and the 
Group Works Council developing a common understanding of the 
use of AI and ML at Commerzbank in order to integrate employees 
and their know-how into new processes and changed ways of 
working. This allows the advantages of these technologies to be 
exploited while at the same time avoiding errors and misuse. 
BDAA provides methods for efficiently designing Group-wide 
models to calculate credit and operational risk as well as capital 
requirements, and to perform stress testing. This helps to ensure 
regulatory compliance and improve capital efficiency. To comply 
with 
the 
high 
data 
protection 
standards, 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft works with pseudonymisation, anonymisation 
and micro-segmentation. 
Maintaining dialogue 
For us, product transparency and fairness towards our customers 
mean providing holistic and comprehensible advice on financial 
products, their risks and possible alternatives in accordance with 
long-term needs. This also includes documenting the advisory 
process in transparent fashion. In recent years, we have

introduced new products and services with particular customer 
benefits. These include a green ecosystem, green mortgage loans 
and the new “money mate” investment solution.  
All Group units actively engage with their customers so as to 
take account of usage requirements in the (further) development 
of products and services. This ensures that the customer and/or 
user experience (CX/UX) with our products, services and channels 
meets up to our quality standards. From idea development and 
conception to design and development, customers are involved in 
the various product stages. This gives rise to a continuous 
dialogue, including in a UX studio set up specifically for this 
purpose. The comdirect brand also carries out activities to foster 
customer loyalty within the “comdirect community”, where 
customers and others with an interest in the financial markets can 
discuss products and other financial topics with one another as 
well as with the Bank. 
 
 
 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s Corporate Clients segment 
takes account of regular customer surveys on specific topics in 
order to develop its range of products and services. This provides 
us with information on customer preferences and requirements, 
which can be used in the design of products and processes. In 
addition, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft actively involves its 
customers through various customer advisory councils. In a 
central advisory council and various regional advisory councils, 
selected figures from companies, institutions and public life have 
the opportunity to enter into direct dialogue with the Board of 
Managing Directors, find out about the performance of the 
business and contribute their experience and expectations. 
Surveying target groups 
SME 
topics 
are 
at 
the 
heart 
of 
Commerzbank’s 
“Unternehmerperspektiven” initiative (Business Owners’ Views). 
Once a year it surveys owners and top-level managers from 
companies of different sizes and from different industries. In 2023, 
1,500 companies were surveyed as part of a study entitled 
“Wirtschaft nach der Zeitenwende: Wie resilient ist der 
Mittelstand” (Economy after the turn of the century: How resilient 
are SMEs?). The study employs a breakdown based on industry 
and size, with size brackets ranging from annual sales of €2–15m 
to over €250m. The survey of first-level managers focused on core 
topics such as current challenges and dealing with crisis 
situations, assessing company resilience and preparing for future 
crises. 
Improving advisory services 
With the amendment of the MiFID II Directive as part of the EU 
Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth, it became 
mandatory to ask about sustainability preferences when providing 
investment advisory and financial portfolio management services. 
Our investment advisory teams received intensive training on this 
topic. As part of the fact-finding stage, we educate customers 
about the three sustainability standards defined in the guideline 
and ask about their sustainability preferences. Where they have a 
sustainability preference, customers subsequently decide on the 
share of their investments to be put into sustainable assets. The 
advisory universe in the Private and Small-Business Customers 
segment comprises some 500 financial instruments that meet at 
least one of the sustainability standards defined by MiFID II. 
Regardless of this, sustainability is generally an integral part of 
various consulting tools, for example in dialogue with our small-
business customers and in wealth management. 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is building up a green 
ecosystem for sustainability-related issues that lie outside our core 
competencies. In 2023, we launched the Impact Solutions platform 
together with our subsidiary neosfer. This free Internet platform 
hosts a variety of sustainable solutions and services for our 
corporate and small-business customers, including providers from 
the areas of energy efficiency, mobility, resource conservation and 
consulting services. In this way, we offer innovative companies the 
opportunity to position themselves on the market and gain access 
to a large customer base. At the same time, we support our 
customers in driving forward their sustainable transformation.  
On top of this, we have entered into several cooperation 
partnerships, among them with Global Changer, a technology 
company with environmental services that helps our corporate and 
small-business customers reduce their CO2 emissions and thus 
achieve their climate targets.  
Private customers can use a CO2 calculator in the banking app 
and on the Commerzbank website to work out their approximate 
personal carbon footprint based on a questionnaire about their 
mobility and consumption habits and their living situation. This 
application is supplemented by information on sustainable 
lifestyles and sustainable product offerings from Commerzbank. 
Our private customers also receive advice on the topic of “acting 
sustainably” in their online banking via the “FinanzKompass” 
digital advisory tool, where we give individual recommendations 
on changes they can make in their day-to-day lives such as 
activating their electronic mailbox to save paper. 
To make Commerzbank’s products and services available to all 
interested parties and customers, we also go to great lengths to 
ensure that our branches and online offering are fully accessible.

Aktiengesellschaft are equipped with (partial) read-aloud functions 
for the visually impaired. Further information on our efforts to be 
inclusive, including towards our employees, can be found under 
“Driving inclusion”.  
5. Leading by example 
 
We are conscious of our responsibility as a company and want to 
make an active contribution to the transformation to a resilient 
society that is both socially and environmentally sustainable. That 
is why we not only want to support our customers in their 
transformations, but also to set a good example ourselves. We will 
achieve this, among other ways, by continuously reducing our 
environmental footprint. At the same time we want to be a reliable 
partner for our stakeholders, and our actions are guided by ethical 
values such as integrity and fairness.  
In addition, we take our responsibility as an employer seriously 
and promote diversity and equal opportunities in practice. Lastly, 
we positively influence our environment through our voluntary 
commitment to charitable causes and our foundations. 
Reducing operational emissions 
Commerz-
bank 
Aktienge-
sellschaft 
has had an 
ISO 14001-certified environmental management system in place 
ever since 2009, followed in 2015 by an energy management 
system certified to ISO 50001. We have established an integrated 
environmental and energy management system (iUEMS) in 
accordance with our environmental guidelines, which defines the 
responsibilities, behaviour, processes and specifications for the 
implementation of the operational environmental and energy 
policy and documents these in a structured manner. The focus is 
on optimising resource consumption, particularly where we can 
have a direct impact on the environment, such as in building 
management and business trips. 
First and foremost, the iUEMS serves to continuously improve 
our own environmental and energy performance. At the same 
time, it helps minimise risk: by regularly observing and checking 
the current situation, any need for action can be identified at an 
early stage and preventive measures can be taken.  
This integrated management system forms a basis for ensuring 
our business has a sustainable orientation. The overarching 
materiality analysis is used to determine the focus topics of the 
iUEMS as part of measuring their internal relevance for our own 
banking operations. The topics of climate protection and 
adaptation, environmental protection, biodiversity, resource use 
and conservation, and circular solutions were classified as 
relevant. We also measure and analyse potentially influential 
environmental impacts with regard to these topics, with a strategic 
focus on the aspect of climate protection. 
 
 
 
We achieve savings in our operational emissions through 
efficient and sustainable building management in particular, and 
we are taking various measures to achieve this. Among other 
things, we have implemented software to optimise building 
management technology at two locations. The programme 
controls the operation of the systems in a forward-looking manner, 
taking into account the weather.  
We continuously review the energy efficiency of our buildings 
using defined energy performance indicators. We were able to 
reduce the electricity consumption measure at both locations. 
Following this positive experience, we are now examining the 
introduction of such software at additional locations.  
In addition, special attention is paid to making travel activities 
as environmentally friendly as possible and thus preventing CO2 
emissions. The business travel policy therefore envisages rail as 
the preferred means of transport. This also means avoiding air 
travel wherever possible. The Bank subsidises electric vehicles in 
its car leasing schemes. In addition, Commerzbank pays its 
employees in Germany a monthly mobility allowance of €20 for 
commuting by public transport, which since 2023 also applies to 
the Deutschlandticket. The range of climate-friendly alternatives 
also includes bicycle leasing programme.  
Key 
figure: 
In 
2023, 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft 
generated 76,591 tonnes of CO2-equivalent total emissions.  
 
The focus is on optimising resource consumption,

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
 
This is slightly higher than in 2021, which had been heavily 
impacted by coronavirus measures, but well below the emissions 
of previous years. The reasons for this include technical 
adaptations for energy efficiency in building management and 
changes in occupational mobility, as well as the progress made 
with implementing the “Strategy 2024” programme. We had set 
ourselves the goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 
30% by 2025 (relative to the base year 2018). We in fact already 
achieved this goal in 2022, with CO2 emissions of 78,402 tonnes, 
equating to a decrease of 34.9%. We were able to reduce our 
operational carbon footprint even further in 2023, despite the 
resurgence in business travel. Our 2023 CO2 emissions of 76,591 t 
constitute a decrease of 36.4% compared to the 2018 base year. 
We have been offsetting Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s 
currently unavoidable emissions in Germany since 2015, and 
globally since 2021. The Bank thus operates in a mathematically 
climate-neutral manner.

The 
table 
shows 
the 
CO2 
emissions 
of 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft according to the global categorisation by the 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Scope 1 designates the 
emissions caused directly, for example through the consumption 
of natural gas, heating oil or fuel. Scope 2 refers to emissions from 
purchased energy. These can be calculated based on either the 
energy mix actually purchased (“market-based”) or the statistical 
country mix (“location-based”). We use market-based scope 2 
emissions to calculate our total emissions. Scope 3 captures other 
indirect emissions from the upstream and downstream value 
chain. These include paper and water consumption, business 
travel and commuting, and other emissions from energy supply. 
The indirect emissions from our financial products (“financed 
emissions”) are not included in the calculation of the operational 
carbon footprint. Commerzbank determines its greenhouse gas 
emissions on the basis of the standard developed by the 
Association for Environmental Management and Sustainability in 
Financial Institutions (VfU). This is based on international 
guidelines for environmental and climate reporting, such as the 
GHG Protocol, CDP and the Global Reporting Initiative. Emissions 
are calculated as CO2 equivalents. To calculate the carbon 
footprint, consumption is first determined for the respective 
categories (e.g. paper and water consumption) and then converted 
into CO2 equivalents using specified conversion factors. This 
results in aggregated CO2 equivalents in the individual categories 
(see disclaimer on page 77). 
Embodying collegiality  
The corporate success of the 
Commerzbank 
Group 
is 
based 
on 
qualified 
and 
motivated employees. Our 
approximately 
42,000 
colleagues worldwide contributed their knowledge and experience 
to our work processes in 2023. A fundamental appreciation of the 
importance of fairness, respect of others and lived diversity is 
anchored in our company values and our Code of Conduct; it is 
our responsibility as an employer to ensure its implementation. 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft aims to offer its staff a working 
environment characterised by a spirit of partnership. Our human 
resources policy makes it possible to promote the development of 
each individual employee and collegial cooperation, even in a 
challenging economic setting.  
 
 
 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft made good progress in the 
year under review with the transformation of the Bank as part of 
“Strategy 2024” and the resulting loss of jobs. The necessary 
headcount reduction has been achieved almost in its entirety. This 
is being done in a socially acceptable manner, and the majority of 
employees have left or will have left the Bank with retirement 
arrangements by the end of 2024.

The Bank’s far-reaching changes have demanded a lot from 
employees over the past three years. This is also reflected in the 
results of the most recent “Pulse Check” survey in autumn 2023. 
The majority of employees at Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft 
enjoy their work, consider collaboration with their direct manager 
to be based on a relationship of trust and value the freedom they 
are granted to make decisions. However, the survey also revealed 
need for action, including in the areas of workload and trust in top 
management, as well as regarding the willingness to recommend 
Commerzbank as a financial service provider and as an employer. 
In individual follow-up processes, the responsible members of the 
Board of Managing Directors and their management boards are 
now pursuing measures to improve those areas that were rated as 
inadequate in their respective segment. But that is not all: With 
the “Strategy 2027”, the workforce-related satisfaction scores will 
be used from 2024 onwards as a control variable alongside 
established financial indicators and customer satisfaction.  
We also focused in the year under review on challenges such as 
demographic change and the resulting shortage of skilled workers. 
In 2023, Commerzbank entered a new phase of transformation and 
is explicitly focusing on the next generation as an investment in 
the future. One of the pledges made as part of the young talent 
campaign was to recruit and nurture graduates, as part of which 
apprentices or students combining a degree course with work 
placement are promised a permanent employment contract if they 
exhibit the appropriate personal and professional suitability. 
Accordingly, the young talent campaign marks the first integral 
component of the strategic recruiting initiative, which focuses on 
planning and implementing the investments in recruiting 
personnel to Commerzbank that are needed following the 
headcount reduction phase over the course of 2023 and 2024. In 
2023, 
these 
included 
increasing 
recruiter 
capacities 
and 
introducing a campaign to recruit new employees through existing 
employees at the Bank. In view of the changed labour market, we 
have formulated the medium-term goal of refining our approach to 
recruiting, placing the applicant at the centre. 
Further initiatives to ensure that the Bank has a healthy 
pipeline of future talent are firmly embedded in the HR strategy: 
our extensive training offering, innovative learning programmes 
and the opportunity to pursue many different development paths 
should make the Bank attractive for talented young people. 
As part of the Sustainability Report in accordance with the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Report), we provide detailed 
information on personnel-related topics. 
Developing employees 
Commerzbank 
Aktien-
gesellschaft offers optional 
and 
mandatory 
training 
modules, such as seminars, 
workshops and e-learning 
courses, designed to prepare employees for the transformation of 
the banking sector resulting from digitalisation and develop their 
skills on an ongoing basis. The voluntary basic qualification on the 
topic of sustainability for all employees of Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft in Germany was supplemented by an advanced 
qualification in 2023. This qualification is specifically designed for 
employees with customer contact, helping us to strengthen our 
expertise 
in 
front-facing 
positions 
and 
consolidate 
the 
understanding of sustainability among the workforce.  
We have also expanded the compulsory and standard 
qualifications to include a third pillar that revolves around self-
determined, interest-based digital learning. With “Lernzeit+” 
(Learning Time+), Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft provides all 
employees with an optional working time quota. Access to this 
digital offering is provided via the learning experience platform cliX. 
 
 
 
Commerz Real offers a model in HR management in which 
employees can choose between variable working hours and trust-
based flexitime. It also attaches great importance to the ongoing 
training of its employees. Virtual formats such as the Sustainability 
Session and Digi Sessions are a platform for cross-disciplinary 
presentation and discussion of the topics of sustainability and 
digitalisation in the real estate and renewable energy sectors and 
in equipment leasing. Commerz Real also permits all employees to 
use the “Learning Time+” model to devote to twelve hours of their 
working time per quarter on further education or training courses. 
In 2023, Commerz Real, in collaboration with the German Society 
for Sustainable Building (DGNB), launched its first mandatory 
basic 
training 
on 
sustainable, 
ESG-compliant 
real 
estate 
management for all employees. The training provides up-to-date 
knowledge on the topic of sustainability and its application in 
industry 
standards 
and 
practices, 
making 
an 
important 
contribution to implementing the Sustainable4Life sustainability 
strategy.

Maintaining health 
Health is the basis for a properly functioning 
organisation and workforce alike. That makes 
strategic health management another key 
element in Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s 
HR activities. Advancing digitalisation and the 
associated opportunities for mobile working are constantly 
changing the requirements in the world of work. We want to 
empower employees and managers to deal with this change under 
their own responsibility and in a way that promotes health. To this 
end, we offer them a wide range of preventive measures such as 
professional advisory and information services. The employee 
offering includes traditional in-person appointments as well as 
alternatives such as webinars, audio formats and video 
consultations 
with 
company 
doctors 
and 
with 
Employee 
Assistance Programme advisors. 
In occupational healthcare management, we place a particular 
focus on prevention. Information, education and exchange formats 
play an important role in this regard. With the regular health 
dialogue introduced in 2023 as an exchange platform for those 
involved 
in 
occupational 
healthcare 
management 
at 
Commerzbank, we are providing impetus and also developing 
offerings for responsible management. Commerzbank also 
supports senior staff in health prevention with an employer-
financed check-up.  
 
 
 
The same applies to Commerz Real. As part of its commitment 
to its employees’ health and satisfaction, the company both 
develops its own concepts and implements measures in 
cooperation with the parent company. Since 2022, Commerz Real 
has been rolling out the new Com.Work office concept across the 
board. Employees can get involved in redesigning the office space. 
In addition to offices that can be booked flexibly, spaces are also 
being created for intensive video calls, interaction or relaxation, 
for example. 
As the pandemic stabilised, mBank introduced a hybrid 
working model, which is implemented according to the specific 
circumstances in sales and contracts units, in operations and in IT. 
It combines the advantages of office work and working from home 
and allows the best workplace to be chosen based on the specific 
tasks to be done. mBank has also launched the “Energised for 
Health” advice programme. This includes courses and training to 
help employees cope with stress and pressure.  
Promoting diversity and equal opportunities 
For 
more 
than three 
decades, 
our 
Diversity 
Management unit has been working to achieve an open and fair 
environment in which everyone feels appreciated. Diversity and 
inclusion are anchored throughout the Group using a governance 
structure with representatives from all areas of the Bank. The 
central committee for strategic alignment is the Global Diversity 
Council, which is chaired by the member of the Board of Managing 
Directors responsible for Human Resources. With all business units 
taking part and support provided by regional councils at various 
locations abroad, this approach makes it possible to take country-
specific differences and needs into account. 
Globally, the Group employs people from 122 nations. Their 
diverse origins vitalise and enrich interactions. Differences in 
viewpoint and experience lead to new ideas. 
Like its parent company, Commerz Real is a signatory to the 
Diversity Charter. Employee awareness of the issues of diversity 
and inclusion is raised through presentations, and human 
resources processes are checked to determine whether they 
ensure equal opportunities and diversity. Parallel to this, mBank in 
Poland is further developing its Diversity and Inclusion Policy and 
is a signatory to the Diversity Charter of the Responsible Business 
Forum. The Diversity and Inclusion Policy not only summarises 
mBank’s efforts to date, but is also as a key component of the 
strategy for the coming years, in keeping with the ESG social 
responsibility goals.  
 
 
 
All measures to promote diversity at mBank are overseen by 
the member of the Board of Managing Directors responsible for 
diversity and inclusion, who is charged with building a diverse 
work environment and coordinating the initiatives planned in the 
policy and any measures resulting from this. Since 2022, all 
employees have completed e-learning courses on the topics of 
diversity and inclusion. In January 2023, mBank was for the third 
time listed in the global Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, which 
tracks the performance of public companies that actively promote 
gender equality in their working environment. mBank is also 
included on the “Diversity IN Check” list for 2023. This is 
published by the Responsible Business Forum and recognises the 
employers in Poland who are setting the bar in their management 
of diversity and inclusion.

Work-life balance  
Alongside professional development, work-life balance is an 
important aspect of remaining attractive as a business. Within 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, this balance is ensured by 
concepts for different stages of life with specific offerings, such as 
flexible working time models, sabbaticals and programmes to 
facilitate the return to work after parental leave.  
We also offer advisory and support services relating to 
childcare, home care and care for the elderly through pme 
Familienservice. With an ageing workforce, taking care of relatives 
is becoming increasingly important. Our offerings aim to raise 
awareness about how to strike a balance between caregiving and 
work and to impart knowledge about the topic of caregiving in our 
working environment. 
We have agreed with the Works Council that we will continue 
and expand the working from home arrangements in Germany 
even after the coronavirus measures have been lifted. Provided 
that remote working is feasible from an operational perspective, 
branch employees were able to work remotely for up to 50% of 
their working hours; at headquarters and in the digital consulting 
centres, the figure was high as 70%. In addition to the positive 
experiences with flexible working during the coronavirus 
pandemic, the overriding factor that persuaded us to take this step 
was the clear desire of the workforce for greater flexibility in 
where they work. In 2023, Commerzbank worked with employee 
representatives on a new rule governing flexible and hybrid 
working. This will come into force from spring 2024. 
HR geared to different phases of life 
 
 
Increasing equal opportunities 
Although a small majority of Commerzbank staff are female 
(around 51%), women are not yet represented at management 
level to the same extent. For this reason, in recent years the 
measures designed to promote a good work-life balance have been 
further improved to open up fresh career opportunities for parents 
in particular. These include company childcare, part-time models – 
including for managers – and structured return-to-work options to 
prevent careers from stalling.  
Key figure: At the end of 2023, 36.1% of management 
positions across the Group were held by women. 
 
 
 
These measures enabled Commerzbank to increase the proportion 
of women in leadership positions to more than 36% Group-wide 
last year. The Board of Managing Directors has set a new goal of 
40% across all management levels by the end of 2030 
(management levels 1 to 4 and project managers at level 5). All 
divisions of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft are explicitly tasked 
with actively approaching suitable female employees during the 
recruitment process. For example, one Risk Management initiative 
focused on equality, mental health and internationalism under the 
banner “Colourful Group Risk Management”. Group Services also 
celebrated the lived diversity of its workforce through the 
“COO.bunt” (COO.colourful) campaign. The aim is to further 
increase the proportion of female candidates for management 
positions when filling new positions. A detailed overview of the 
proportion of female employees broken down by management 
level can be found in our GRI Report. 
Driving inclusion 
The inclusion of people with disabilities is another integral 
component of our diversity strategy. With our inclusion action 
plan, which was published on the basis of the UN Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD), in 2018 we 
became the first bank in Germany to make a voluntary public 
commitment on the issue. In the action plan we have committed to

goals and measures aimed at improving the situation of people 
with disabilities within Commerzbank. This includes employees, 
customers and suppliers of the Bank and encompasses barrier-free 
access to the workplace and to working tools as well as the 
implementation of accessibility in our digital offerings for 
customers. Our efforts apply equally to the next generation. With 
that in mind, we advertise on myAbility, a job platform for people 
with disabilities that aims to further promote diversity and 
inclusion. On top of that, in 2023 we continued to work on 
implementing appropriate measures and launched a follow-up 
action plan for Inclusion 2.0. 
The result: Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft has consistently 
exceeded the legal requirement of 5% employees with disabilities 
in recent years, and – at 5.6% the year under review – met the 
quota in 2023 as well.  
Treating each other with respect 
A working environment that is free from prejudice, typified by 
mutual respect and acceptance is essential for an atmosphere 
where everyone is able to thrive. This is especially important in a 
group such as ours that employs people from over 120 nations. We 
do not tolerate discrimination at Commerzbank. Any form of 
unfavourable treatment of people based on their gender, 
nationality, ethnic origin, religion or beliefs, disability, age, sexual 
orientation or gender identity constitutes a violation of human 
dignity and infringement of personal rights. 
As part of our mission of promoting an open and honest 
approach to dealing with the topic of sexual orientation and the 
gender identity of employees, customers and business contacts, 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft focused on several transgender 
initiatives in 2023. These included reviewing our processes and 
forms to ensure that customers are addressed in neutral terms, 
and also adding a gender-neutral option to the standard forms of 
address, for example when opening an account. In addition, since 
2023, Commerzbank and comdirect have given people who are 
transitioning the opportunity to have their debit and credit cards 
reissued in a name that affirms their new gender, if they wish.  
 
 
 
Through publication of the “Prout Performer” lists, the 
Prout@Work Foundation recognised individuals from business and 
public life who stand up for the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
trans, inter and queer people and become role models. Another 
ten Commerzbank employees received awards in the year under 
review. 
Commerzbank also takes a clear stance in public. “More 
diversity. More acceptance. More pride.” was our motto for the 
2023 Pride season. At Christopher Street Day, we again took part 
in the parade with our own Commerzbank float. As in the previous 
year, the Commerzbank Tower was lit up to celebrate Pride, and 
colourful versions of the Bank’s logo appeared in digital channels 
and applications. 
Ensuring integrity and compliance 
Integrity is the basis of our 
business model. We act in an 
attentive, 
trustworthy 
and 
reliable manner. The globally 
binding Code of Conduct 
summarises our understanding of impeccable ethical and moral 
behaviour. It goes beyond legal and regulatory requirements and 
sets standards for Commerzbank Group employees and service 
providers. 
The focus of Commerzbank’s compliance activities is on 
preventing and uncovering money laundering, terrorist financing, 
market abuse (insider trading and market manipulation), fraud, 
corruption and other criminal acts and ensuring compliance with 
financial sanctions and embargoes wherever the Bank does 
business, as well as on protecting investors. We also ensure that 
insider information and other confidential data about our 
customers and their transactions are protected in accordance with 
the need-to-know principle. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s 
Compliance division has wide-ranging authority and escalation 
rights, including powers to obtain information and carry out 
investigations, enabling it to implement its requirements 
throughout the Group.  
Managing compliance risks 
As a proactive risk manager, Group Compliance manages 
compliance risk throughout the Group and thus lays the 
foundation for compliance with laws, ethical standards and 
regulations. Our goal is to effectively manage compliance risks 
and identify them at an early stage before they materialise. 
Compliance risks are identified and managed across all 
compliance risk types as part of the compliance programme that 
has been put in place and is continuously refined. Components of 
the programme include a regular Group-wide compliance risk 
analysis, internal safeguards, and controls to assess the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the compliance management system. 
In order to satisfy the requirements of increasingly complex 
national and international legislation and regulations, the Group is 
continually developing its compliance risk management and 
bringing this in line with current developments and challenges.  
 
 
“More diversity. More acceptance. More Pride.”

In the area ofsanctions compliance, a top priority is the 
implementation of comprehensive sanctions and embargoes 
against Russia. Recent regulatory measures have focused on 
combating the evasion of sanctions and embargoes. To ensure that 
the imposed sanctions have the greatest possible effect, the most 
recent 
restrictive 
measures 
entail 
increasingly 
detailed 
requirements, including detailed exemption provisions, which 
must be observed when implementing the sanctions provisions. 
The German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in 
Supply Chains (LkSG) came into force on 1 January 2023. One of 
its main objectives is to improve the protection of human rights in 
supply chains. Under the act, Commerzbank is required to identify 
and prevent violations of certain human rights and certain 
environmental obligations at direct and indirect suppliers and in 
its own business activities. 
Within Commerzbank, the principles of the “three lines of 
defence model” also apply in this area, as part of risk 
management, with the goal of identifying, preventing and 
remedying risks and breaches in supply chains. Commerzbank has 
set up a comprehensive compliance programme to ensure that 
these requirements are met. Group Compliance will act in the 
second line of defence as the “global functional lead”, in which 
capacity it will define minimum Group-wide standards for the 
Bank.  
When the LkSG came into force, we updated and published a 
policy statement on the company’s due diligence obligations with 
respect to human rights and environmental risks as well as 
Commerzbank’s position on human rights. Furthermore, the Chief 
Compliance Officer was appointed as the Bank’s human rights 
officer. 2023 saw the finalisation of the expanded compliance 
management system to include the requirements of the LkSG and 
its integration into the foreign units and relevant subsidiaries.  
 
 
 
This global policy for the protection of human rights and the 
environment defines the principles for dealing with human and 
environmental rights in the supply chain and sets the minimum 
standards for fulfilling the requirements of the LkSG. The law 
requires that companies carry out an annual and event-based risk 
analysis. The focus here is on uncovering risks for vulnerable 
groups that arise from the operational business of Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft – known as the “inside-out” perspective.  
These legal requirements are specified in the handout on 
implementing a risk analysis according to the specifications of the 
German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply 
Chains of the Federal Office of Economics and Export Control 
(BAFA) from August 2022. 
Commerzbank carried out an initial risk analysis for the first 
time 
in 
2022 
and 
evaluated 
both 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft’s direct suppliers and its own business area. 
Limited inherent risks were identified among suppliers in relation 
to the legal positions of “forced labour and slavery”, “disregard for 
occupational safety and work-related health risks”, “withholding of 
appropriate wages” and “destruction of the natural basis of 
existence through environmental pollution”. Risk-appropriate 
prevention measures were taken. However, no remedial action was 
necessary because there was no knowledge of past or imminent 
violations of the protected legal positions. Commerzbank has 
subsequently expanded the policy statement to include rights-
holder groups, ship crews and groups of people dependent on 
fishing and tourism who could potentially be affected by these 
risks. 
Commerzbank is firmly committed both to preventing and to 
punishing white-collar criminal acts and violations of legal, 
regulatory 
or 
internal 
requirements 
in 
connection 
with 
Commerzbank. To that end, Commerzbank has for many years 
operated an ISO data protection-certified electronic whistleblower 
system for submitting complaints and tips on issues in the 
categories of “human rights violations” and “environmental 
violations and risks”. Reports can be made by name or 
anonymously. All information is treated in the strictest confidence 
and all personal data are protected.  
Fighting corruption effectively 
In our fight against corruption and bribery, we go further than 
simply focusing on statutory requirements such as the German 
Criminal Code, the UK Bribery Act or the US Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act. We also adhere to the principles of the UN Global 
Compact and the OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, 
and comply with the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of 
Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. 
These external standards are supplemented with internal 
guidelines, which are reviewed at least annually and updated as 
needed: Commerzbank’s Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
Policy (ABC Policy) actively seeks to combat bribery and other 
forms of corruption. 
To this end, we conduct regular training sessions for our 
employees so that they can implement our guidelines competently 
and consistently. A central element of this is the annual anti-
corruption training for all employees.  
 
 
Group Compliance lays the foundation
for compliance with laws, ethical standards
and regulations
 
 
 
 
 
 
74 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Business and functional units with heightened risk profiles and 
individuals who have an increased risk of bribery and corruption 
due to their functions at Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft receive 
additional targeted training.  
 
 
 
A team with special training in this type of risk is available to 
provide advice to all employees. Commerzbank has a zero-
tolerance approach to corruption and other criminal acts by 
employees. Any employee who is proven to have breached this will 
face the full consequences under labour, civil and criminal law. 
Key figure: As in previous years, there were no known cases of 
corruption in the Commerzbank Group in 2023. 
Working for the good of society 
With 
regard 
to 
its 
social 
commit-
ment, 
Commerzbank engages with its environment in a variety of ways. 
Various projects and initiatives developed together with partners 
from business and society contribute to the good of society. 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft in Germany also donated a total 
of €690,113 to various institutions and organisations in the year 
under review. 
As in the previous year, Commerzbank decided not to produce 
a big Christmas film for its customers in 2023 and instead donated 
the money to charitable causes. The donation by the Bank 
combined with the participation of employees and customers 
helped collect €500,000 for food banks in Germany in 2022. In 
2023, the campaign benefited brotZeit e.V. – an association that 
promotes equal opportunities by providing free breakfasts at 
primary schools and schools for children with learning difficulties. 
The Hamas terrorist attack on Israel likewise caused a great 
deal of shock and dismay at Commerzbank. In order to send a 
clear signal against all forms of hatred and anti-Semitism, we took 
a stand on the issue in October 2023 by means of an 
advertisement in two national Sunday newspapers, together with 
numerous other German companies.  
One example of our social and environmental engagement is 
the Commerzbank environmental internship launched with the 
German national parks back in 1990. In 2023, it again provided 
around 60 students with practical experience in the areas of 
environmental education and public relations in national parks and 
biosphere reserves. Commerzbank finances the internships, while 
the umbrella organisation Nationale Naturlandschaften e.V. 
organises the programme, and the protected areas provide the 
interns with hands-on training and support. More than 2,000 
students have now completed an environmental internship and 
subsequently applied their experience to business, politics, society 
or environmental protection.

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is also involved in the “Finanz-
Heldinnen” (“financial heroines”) initiative to get more women 
interested in finance. The initiative was set up in 2018 by a group 
of female comdirect employees with the aim of making a positive 
contribution to society. To help women become better acquainted 
with the topic of finance and make independent financial 
decisions, the financial heroines convey their knowledge through a 
variety of formats, including an online magazine, podcasts, 
afterwork events and an Instagram channel, as well as the 
bestselling book “Der Finanzplaner für Frauen” (Financial planner 
for women). 
As a corporate citizen, Commerz Real wants to make an active 
contribution to society in the communities in which it operates. 
Donations of money, material and time are mobilised for this 
purpose each year. For example, Commerz Real makes a financial 
contribution to selected social organisations that support

disadvantaged children. In addition, employees fulfil children’s 
Christmas wishes with donations in kind as part of the “Wish Tree 
Campaign”. At the Social Days 2023, just like in the previous year, 
employees were given the opportunity to invest their time for a 
good cause: on one day, more than 140 people embraced the spirit 
of social commitment and helped out on the ground in social 
meeting places. The aim was to improve networking for residents 
in places with greater social needs, to reduce prejudices and to 
improve living situations in the area. Commerz Real is also 
continuing its existing work supporting disadvantaged children 
and promoting digital education at schools.  
In 2023, mBank was the exclusive banking partner and sponsor 
for the sixth time of the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity 
Foundation (GOCC). Via its customers, mBank has raised a total of 
more than €22m (97m Polish zloty) for the initiatives selected by 
the GOCC Grand Finale over the last six years. 
The war in Ukraine is a constant presence, especially in 
neighbouring Poland. mBank started a partnership with a non-
governmental organisation – the Polish Centre for International 
Aid (PCPM) – allowing customers to donate money to help people 
fleeing the war. The Bank’s online payments enable donations to 
be linked directly to this organisation. More than €3m (14m Polish 
zloty) were donated by customers. Customers can deposit money 
via online banking, the mobile app or the website using the “Ich 
helfe” (I’d like to help) button developed with Paynow. PCPM 
provides these funds for the reconstruction of destroyed Ukrainian 
cities, schools, hospitals and other critical infrastructure, so that 
refugees can return to their homes. A Ukrainian primary school for 
around 230 students was housed at mBank’s premises in the 
2022/2023 school year. 
Foundations for the future 
Various foundations supported by the Group over the long term 
also make a significant contribution to society. As a corporate 
foundation, the Commerzbank Foundation promotes the social 
responsibility of its founding company to work towards a society 
fit for the future. Its motto is: Participation creates the future. With 
its independent foundation, Commerzbank takes responsibility for 
its sustainable commitment to be a “good citizen” of the 
community that goes beyond its actual business activities. Since it 
was established in 1970, the Commerzbank Foundation has built 
up many partnerships across Germany and has thus become a 
firmly established provider of support in the world of German 
foundations. In its more than 50-year history, it has provided a 
total of around €40m to support well over 1,000 projects relating 
to cultural, social and scientific activities. Its partnership network 
ranges from museums and theatres to non-profit social 
organisations and scientific institutions, from national lighthouse 
projects to exemplary local initiatives.  
 
 
 
The funding always supports cultural education and mediation, 
social participation for disadvantaged people and incentives for 
young researchers. In addition, seven social foundations have 
been established to provide financial support to active and retired 
employees in unforeseeable emergencies. The common aim of all 
the foundations is to make a long-term and sustainable 
contribution to the future viability of society. Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft provided a total of €638,000 in funding for 
these foundations in 2023, covering expenses such as staff, 
workstations, premises costs and other operating costs.  
 
 
 
mFoundation in Poland focuses on mathematical literacy. It 
supports children, parents, teaching staff, students and young 
scientists with multiple funding programmes. In 2023, this 
included programmes for schools and nursery schools and a 
competition for the best academic thesis in mathematics. Young 
artists are another focal point. Through its “M für mBank 
Malkunst-Sammlung” (M for mBank painting collection) fund, the 
Bank buys paintings by up-and-coming Polish artists. These 
artworks are selected on behalf of mBank by a committee of highly 
regarded representatives of the art market and a representative of 
mBank. By the end of 2023, the collection consisted of 131 works 
of art.

Disclaimer 
The CO2eq emissions were determined according to VfU standard 1.1 (standard of the Association for Environmental Management and 
Sustainability in Financial Institutions) using the key figures in the version dated July 2022. External verification was performed based on 
ISO 14064-3 by DNV Business Assurance Zertifizierung GmbH. DNV is one of the world’s leading providers of accredited management 
system certifications and considers itself an expert in assurance and risk management. DNV is committed to impartiality in its certification 
activities. The audit includes the qualitative and computational inspection of data and content, including conducting interviews with 
various specialists. The focus of the audit is on identifying data gaps and inconsistencies and evaluating methods for extrapolation. There 
is no complete review of the underlying data to achieve unlimited assurance. 
The VfU standard is aligned with international environmental and climate reporting standards such as GRI and the GHG Protocol. The 
determined and verified consumption quantities are multiplied in the VfU tool by CO2eq emission factors, which are based on the 
EcoInvent database. EcoInvent is a platform of scientific and public institutions constituting one of the world’s largest databases in the 
field of environmental accounting. Quality assurance is provided by scientific processes and assessments (critical review / peer review). In 
our capacity as user of the factors, we cannot evaluate these processes ourselves. The greenhouse gas conversion factors are provided by 
Greendelta. Greendelta’s selection of EcoInvent processes and GHG factors was reviewed by the Öko-Institut research institute. The VfU 
has integrated additional control instances (both for the data in the database and for the selection of data used in the VfU tool).  
More detailed information on consumption values can be found in Commerzbank’s GRI Report 2023, which will be published in 
summer 2024.

• Disclose the organisation’s governance 
around climate-related risks and

Commerzbank has a comprehensive 
sustainability governance setup. The Group 
Sustainability Board, which is a decision-
making and escalation body chaired by the 
Chairman of the Board of Managing 
Directors, sets the Bank’s strategic 
sustainability targets and monitors the 
measures for their implementation and 
management. Group Sustainability 
Management is responsible for the ongoing 
development of the sustainability strategy 
and coordinates all of Commerzbank’s 
sustainability activities through the Group 
programme “Sustainability 360°”. The 
Bank’s sustainability governance is 
supplemented by the ESG Committee of the 
Supervisory Board and an external 
Sustainability Advisory Board, led by the 
Chairman of the Board of Managing 
Directors, to ensure a constructive and 
critical dialogue with our stakeholders.

climate-related risks and opportunities on the 
organisation’s business activity, strategy and

material 
Sustainability has been an integral part of 
our corporate strategy since as far back as 
2020. Our current “Moving forward” 
strategy is based on the three pillars of 
growth, excellence and responsibility. 
Responsibility represents the entire 
sustainability spectrum of environmental, 
social and governance (ESG). Our net zero 
commitment forms the core of our 
sustainability strategy, which was approved 
by the Board of Managing Directors and 
published in the ESG framework. This 
strategy is subdivided into “transformation 
finance” and “sustainable finance” and 
defines exclusion criteria and minimum 
standards. As part of the materiality 
analysis, nine topics – including, in 
particular, climate protection and adaptation 
as well as biodiversity – were identified as 
material for us and incorporated into the 
annual Bank-wide strategy process in 2022.

A cross-risk-type materiality analysis for 
climate-related and biodiversity risks that 
considers both transition and physical risks 
confirms our classification that climate-
related and biodiversity risks should not be 
considered separate risk types, but rather 
horizontal material risks. The individual risk 
assessment for lending also includes 
scenario and risk analyses of impact and 
resilience with regard to climate-related and 
biodiversity risks.

science-based CO2 reduction targets from 
the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). 
As part of these efforts, we published our 
portfolio intensities in emissions-intensive 
sectors for the first time in 2022 and had 
them validated by SBTi. We want to reduce 
the CO2 emissions of our own banking 
operations to net zero as early as 2040 and 
we expect climate neutrality from our 
suppliers by 2040. We aim to mobilise 
€300bn for sustainable financial products by 
2025 and have already achieved €238bn of 
this amount.

In order to reduce our impact on nature, we 
have been integrating appropriate exclusion 
criteria into our core business for many years. 
We also classify the nature-related application 
of funds in the ESG framework as sustainable 
financing with a view to supporting 
corresponding lending opportunities. The 
protection of biodiversity therefore plays a 
crucial role achieving our goal of mobilising 
€300bn for sustainable financial products. As 
part of a new risk and impact analysis, 
expanded to include an initial scenario 
analysis, we have determined the key sectors 
in the loan portfolio with nature-related risks 
and impacts. The main drivers of risks and 
negative impacts have also been identified. 
The protection of biodiversity is likewise taken 
into account in our own banking operations as 
part of the integrated environmental and 
energy management system and with respect 
to measures aimed at optimising the 
consumption of resources.

As part of a new materiality analysis in 2022, 
the topic of diversity was identified as material 
and incorporated into the annual Bank-wide 
strategy process. The topic is therefore 
increasingly being pursued at a strategic level 
and shifting into the focus of sustainability 
management. The analysis of nature-related 
risks and impacts incorporated two TNFD 
scenario narratives and was carried out using 
the “ENCORE” tool. On the basis of the 
results, we identified potential areas of action 
and strategic priorities and will develop 
further analyses and measures to protect 
biodiversity. Biodiversity has additionally been 
classified as essential for our own banking 
operations and is taken into account 
accordingly.

Principle 2: Impact and Target Setting 
We will continuously increase our positive impacts while reducing the negative impacts on, and managing the risks to, people and 
environment resulting from our activities, products and services. To this end, we will set and publish targets where we can have the 
most significant impacts. 
2.1   Impact Analysis (Key Step 1) 
Show that your bank has performed an impact analysis of its portfolio/s to identify its most significant impact areas and determine priority areas 
for target-setting. The impact analysis shall be updated regularly5 and fulfil the following requirements/elements (a-d)6: 
a) Scope: What is the scope of your bank’s impact analysis? Please describe which parts of the bank’s core business areas, products/services 
across the main geographies that the bank operates in (as described under 1.1) have been considered in the impact analysis. Please also 
describe which areas have not yet been included, and why. 
Materiality analysis 
As part of the materiality analysis for 2022, we identified the topic areas that are most relevant to us. A 
list of potential sustainability topics was analysed along two materiality perspectives – the “impact 
perspective” and the “business perspective”. To measure the impact perspective, we conducted an 
exposure analysis to reveal “sustainability hotspots”. These are in countries and sectors where 
Commerzbank is particularly active, and where sustainability indicators in the defined areas are 
significantly below average. The business perspective – i.e. the question of how high the opportunities 
and 
risks 
of 
these 
sustainability 
issues 
are 
for 
business  
success – was established in a management workshop. 
Sustainable portfolio management using the SBTi method 
We have set ourselves the strategic goal of reducing the carbon footprint of the Bank’s entire loan and 
investment portfolio to net zero by no later than 2050. We take a holistic approach to our net zero 
commitment and manage sustainability across all relevant areas of the Bank. To make this approach 
transparent, we have joined the SBTi and manage our defined portfolios with a particular focus on the 
emission-intensive sectors.

b) Portfolio composition: Has your bank considered the composition of its portfolio (in %) in the analysis? Please provide proportional 
composition of your portfolio globally and per geographical scope 
i) by sectors & industries7 for business, corporate and investment banking portfolios (i.e. sector exposure or industry breakdown in %), 
and/or  
ii) by products & services and by types of customers for consumer and retail banking portfolios.  
If your bank has taken another approach to determine the bank’s scale of exposure, please elaborate, to show how you have considered where 
the bank’s core business/major activities lie in terms of industries or sectors. 
Sustainable portfolio management using the SBTi method 
Using the SBTi methodology, the Bank identified the CO2-intensive sectors within its overall portfolio, 
determined the level of CO2 pollution associated with these sub-portfolios and calculated concrete 
sector-specific reduction targets that are in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Our focus is on 
those areas of the value chain where high CO2 emissions are generated or which cause high 
downstream CO2 emissions. Accordingly, when setting the SBTi targets, we took into account the 
following segments of the value chain that are currently classified as especially emissions-intensive: 
power generation, aviation, automotive manufacturing, commercial real estate financing, and the 
production of cement, iron and steel. We will likewise consider the retail mortgage financing portfolio, 
which is deemed optional in the SBTi analysis. 
The composition of the reduction pathways and portfolio targets under the SBTi method are published 
in the ESG framework. Further information on the portfolio breakdown can also be found in this non-
financial report in the chapter “Reducing financed emissions” and in our disclosure report in 
accordance with CRR.

and/or your clients operate?8 Please describe how these have been considered, including what stakeholders you have engaged to help inform 
this element of the impact analysis. 
This step aims to put your bank’s portfolio impacts into the context of society’s needs. 
 
 
 
 
5 That means that where the initial impact analysis has been carried out in a previous period, the information should be updated accordingly, the scope expanded as well as the quality 
of the impact analysis improved over time. 
6 Further guidance can be found in the Interactive Guidance on impact analysis and target setting. 
7 Key sectors’ relative to different impact areas, i.e. those sectors whose positive and negative impacts are particularly strong, are particularly relevant here

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Materiality analysis 
Nine topics were identified as material as part of the materiality analysis. These topics relate to all three 
sustainability dimensions – environmental, social and governance – and currently form the focus of our 
sustainability management activities. Climate change continues to have the highest relevance for the 
Bank. At the same time, topics such as biodiversity and circular solutions have shifted into greater focus 
than in previous materiality analyses. 
Materiality analysis for environmental risks  
At Commerzbank, we do not consider climate-related risks as a separate type of risk, but as a horizontal 
risk. This can materialise across the different known types of risk such as credit risk or market risk. The 
materiality analysis for environmental risks is carried out on a comprehensive basis across all risk types. 
In 2023, the analysis encompassed an assessment of all risk types that had been classified as material in 
the risk inventory in terms of factors such as the materiality of their impact in relation to climate-related 
risks. We provide a transparent overview of the results of the materiality analysis in the “Managing 
environmental risks” section of this non-financial report (page 57 ff.). 
Biodiversity-specific impact analysis using “ENCORE” 
In 2023, we carried out a second biodiversity-specific impact analysis, revised and expanded compared 
to the previous year, using the “ENCORE” tool. ENCORE provides a science-based link between 
economic activities and biodiversity-damaging impacts. In our analysis, we compared the business 
volume of the sectors we finance with the tool’s external data. This allowed us to identify potential areas 
of action and strategic priorities and, building on this, to develop further analyses and measures to 
protect biodiversity. We provide a transparent overview of the results of the biodiversity-specific impact 
analysis in the “Evaluating environmental and social risks” section of this non-financial report (page 50 
ff.).

d) For these (min. two prioritized impact areas): Performance measurement: Has your bank identified which sectors & industries as well as 
types of customers financed or invested in are causing the strongest actual positive or negative impacts? Please describe how you assessed 
the performance of these, using appropriate indicators related to significant impact areas that apply to your bank’s context.  
In determining priority areas for target-setting among its areas of most significant impact, you should consider the bank’s current 
performance levels, i.e. qualitative and/or quantitative indicators and/or proxies of the social, economic and environmental impacts resulting 
from the bank’s activities and provision of products and services. If you have identified climate and/or financial health&inclusion as your most 
significant impact areas, please also refer to the applicable indicators in the Annex.  
If your bank has taken another approach to assess the intensity of impact resulting from the bank’s activities and provision of products and 
services, please describe this.  
The outcome of this step will then also provide the baseline (incl. indicators) you can use for setting targets in two areas of most significant impact. 
The transformation into a sustainable economy affects us all. We aim to shape this change in a proactive 
manner. We want to make our contribution to aligning global financial flows with the goals of the Paris 
Agreement and the EU Green Deal, and consequently promote climate-compatible development. 
Materiality analysis 
To apply the materiality analysis and the identified impact areas in the Bank’s operations, the results 
were incorporated into the Bank-wide strategy process and discussed at the level of the Board of 
Managing Directors. 
Sustainable portfolio management using the SBTi method 
The portfolio targets are published in our ESG framework where they, along with the status of target 
achievement, are updated on a regular basis. The “Reduction targets under the Sectoral 
Decarbonization Approach (SDA)” table in this non-financial report (page 53) shows the CO2 reduction 
pathways we have defined from here until 2030 by sector. The percentage reductions derive from the 
applicable emission intensity for the baseline year 2021 and the targets for 2030.

Sustainability has been an integral part of our corporate strategy since as far back as 2020. We want to 
make our contribution to aligning global financial flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement and the 
EU Green Deal, and consequently promote climate-compatible development.  
Climate protection (net zero targets) 
Our net zero commitment is at the heart of the sustainability strategy adopted by the Board of Managing 
Directors. It is based on two pillars: We support our customers in their sustainable transformations and 
set a good example ourselves. We are committed to reducing all of our financed emissions to net zero, 
mobilising €300bn for sustainable products and achieving the net-zero standard in our banking 
operations. For this purpose, we have joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), the Net-Zero 
Banking Alliance and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), among others. 
Biodiversity 
We are also keenly aware of the relevance of biodiversity, as evidenced by our affiliation with the 
“Biodiversity in Good Company” Initiative (BiGCI) and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial 
Disclosures (TNFD). In December 2023, we adopted a target on deforestation that sets specific 
requirements for our customers in sectors and regions relevant to deforestation. 
Women in management positions 
In addition to the two topics of climate protection and biodiversity, we also focus on the social aspect of 
sustainability – analogous to the topics identified in the materiality analysis. 
As a founding member of the Diversity Charter and a signatory to the UN Women Empowerment 
Principles, we are committed to equality within our organisation. Commerzbank intends to increase the 
proportion of women in management positions. To this end, our Board of Managing Directors has set a 
new and ambitious target of 40% across all management levels by the end of 2030.

b) Baseline: Have you determined a baseline for selected indicators and assessed the current level of alignment? Please disclose the indicators 
used as well as the year of the baseline. 
You can build upon the performance measurement undertaken in 2.1 to determine the baseline for your target. 
 
10 You can respond “Yes” to a question if you have completed one of the described steps, e.g. the initial impact analysis has been carried out, a pilot has been conducted. 
11 Operational targets (relating to for example water consumption in office buildings, gender equality on the bank’s management board or business-trip related greenhouse gas 
emissions) are not in scope of the PRB. 
12 Your bank should consider the main challenges and priorities in terms of sustainable development in your main country/ies of operation for the purpose of setting targets. These can 
be found in National Development Plans and strategies, international goals such as the SDGs or the Paris Climate Agreement, and regional frameworks. Aligning means there should be 
a clear link between the bank’s targets and these frameworks and priorities, therefore showing how the target supports and drives contributions to the national and global goals.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
A package of indicators has been developed for climate change mitigation and financial health & inclusion to guide and support banks in their 
target setting and implementation journey. The overview of indicators can be found in the Annex of this template.  
If your bank has prioritized climate mitigation and/or financial health & inclusion as (one of) your most significant impact areas, it is strongly 
recommended to report on the indicators in the Annex, using an overview table like below including the impact area, all relevant indicators 
and the corresponding indicator codes: 
 
In case you have identified other and/or additional indicators as relevant to determine the baseline and assess the level of alignment towards 
impact driven targets, please disclose these.

To minimise deforestation in our customer portfolio, corporate customers that are active in sectors 
(forestry, soy, palm oil, beef) and regions relevant to deforestation must demonstrate their commitment 
to combating deforestation through relevant memberships (RSPO, GRSB) or certifications (FSC or PEFC, 
RTRS, RSPO) by the end of 2025 at the latest. We continually examine other relevant memberships and 
certificates and will take these into account if the level of ambition and acceptance are comparable.

For each target separately: 
Show that your bank has implemented the actions it had previously defined to meet the set target.  
Report on your bank’s progress since the last report towards achieving each of the set targets and the impact your progress resulted in, using 
the indicators and KPIs to monitor progress you have defined under 2.2. 
Or, in case of changes to implementation plans (relevant for 2nd and subsequent reports only): describe the potential changes (changes to 
priority impact areas, changes to indicators, acceleration/review of targets, introduction of new milestones or revisions of action plans) and 
explain why those changes have become necessary. 
Climate protection (net zero targets) 
KPI 1: The portfolio targets are published in our ESG framework where they, along with the status of 
target achievement, are updated on a regular basis. 
KPI 2: By the end of 2023, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft had mobilised €238bn for sustainable 
financial products, out of a target of €300bn by the end of 2025. 
KPI 3: In 2023, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft generated a total of 76,591 tonnes of CO2-equivalent 
emissions. We already achieved our interim goal (30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, 
starting from base year 2018) in 2022, with CO2 emissions of 78,402 tonnes (decrease of 34.9%). 
Biodiversity 
We adopted our target on deforestation in December 2023.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Principle 3: Clients and Customers 
We will work responsibly with our clients and our customers to encourage sustainable practices and enable economic activities that 
create shared prosperity for current and future generations.  
3.1   Client engagement 
Does your bank have a policy or engagement process with clients and customers14 in place to encourage sustainable practices?  
☒ Yes 
 
☐ In progress 
 
☐ No 
Does your bank have a policy for sectors in which you have identified the highest (potential) negative impacts?  
☒ Yes 
 
☐ In progress 
 
☐ No 
Describe how your bank has worked with and/or is planning to work with its clients and customers to encourage sustainable practices and 
enable sustainable economic activities15). It should include information on relevant policies, actions planned/implemented to support clients’ 
transition, selected indicators on client engagement and, where possible, the impacts achieved. 
This should be based on and in line with the impact analysis, target-setting and action plans put in place by the bank (see P2). 
Global efforts to combat climate change require not only favourable political conditions and new 
technologies, but also adequate financial resources above all. 
We will therefore mobilise €300bn for sustainable financial products by 2025. At the same time, the 
financing of green technologies and business ideas that could mitigate climate change also makes a 
concrete contribution towards the successful transition to a low-carbon, sustainable future economy.

3.2   Business opportunities 
Describe what strategic business opportunities in relation to the increase of positive and the reduction of negative impacts your bank has 
identified and/or how you have worked on these in the reporting period. Provide information on existing products and services, information on 
sustainable products developed in terms of value (USD or local currency) and/or as a % of your portfolio, and which SDGs or impact areas you 
are striving to make a positive impact on (e.g. green mortgages – climate, social bonds – financial inclusion, etc.). 
In order to drive forward sustainable transformation and support our customers in their transformation, 
we develop sustainable products that take into account regulatory requirements, market analyses and 
the Bank’s own specialist and product expertise. These products support our customers in their 
sustainable transformation and at the same time provide incentives for companies and private 
individuals to become more sustainable. 
The sustainable products in the Private and Small-Business Customers segment include green mortgage 
loans, KfW programmes and sustainable asset management. 
The sustainable products in the Corporate Clients segment include the financing of green infrastructure, 
sustainable 
bonds, 
and 
ESG/sustainability-linked 
loans 
and 
promissory 
note 
loans.  
We publish details about our sustainable products in our ESG framework and in the “Supporting the

Principle 4: Stakeholders 
We will proactively and responsibly consult, engage and partner with relevant stakeholders to achieve society’s goals. 
4.1   Stakeholder identification and consultation 
Does your bank have a process to identify and regularly consult, engage, collaborate and partner with stakeholders (or stakeholder groups 16) 
you have identified as relevant in relation to the impact analysis and target setting process?  
☒ Yes 
 
☐ In progress 
 
☐ No 
Please describe which stakeholders (or groups/types of stakeholders) you have identified, consulted, engaged, collaborated or partnered with 
for the purpose of implementing the Principles and improving your bank’s impacts. This should include a high-level overview of how your bank 
has identified relevant stakeholders, what issues were addressed/results achieved and how they fed into the action planning process. 
Corporate responsibility also means seeking regular dialogue with external and internal stakeholders. 
Commerzbank pursues an active and transparent dialogue with a view to satisfying the expectations and 
needs of its stakeholders, taking account of them in its corporate strategy and setting out its own 
perspective.  
We are in dialogue with the following stakeholder groups in particular: 
• Shareholders and investors 
• Research/academia 
• Customers 
• Suppliers 
• Media 
• Employees 
• Competitors/financial sector 
• Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) 
• Politics 
• Civil society 
Commerzbank maintains relationships with numerous organisations and groups which approach the 
company with requests, demands or suggestions. We prioritise dialogue with stakeholder groups which 
have a perceptible impact on Commerzbank’s economic, environmental or social performance or are 
heavily affected by it. 
The discourse on important questions relating to social, economic and financial policy is of great 
importance to us. 
To promote a constructive and critical dialogue with our stakeholders, we have also founded an external 
Sustainability Advisory Board. The experts from the fields of politics, academia, society, NGOs, trade 
unions, and small and SMEs represent a broad spectrum of content and provide impetus for further 
development of our sustainability strategy. 
A detailed run-down of our dialogue with interest groups can be found in our Sustainability Report (GRI 
Report).

5.2   Promoting a culture of responsible banking: 
Describe the initiatives and measures of your bank to foster a culture of responsible banking among its employees (e.g., capacity building, e-
learning, sustainability trainings for client-facing roles, inclusion in remuneration structures and performance management and leadership 
communication, amongst others).   
The corporate values– integrity, performance and responsibility – form the basis of our corporate 
culture. Our Code of Conduct goes beyond legal and regulatory requirements and sets standards for 
Commerzbank Group employees.  
Our human resources policy makes it possible to promote the development of each individual employee 
as well as collegial cooperation overall at Commerzbank. For example, Commerzbank actively supports 
its employees in their personal development and provides targeted offerings to that end. We also offer 
our employees a wide range of information and advice on health-related topics and provide financial 
support within the scope of our occupational healthcare management. 
The Bank additionally offers a “Basic Sustainability Qualification” that enables employees to gain an 
even more comprehensive understanding of the topic of sustainability. For sales and sales-related 
functions, Commerzbank offers a detailed advanced qualification programme to ensure that it has the 
requisite professional expertise on this important topic. 
Further details about the company culture can be found in our Sustainability Report (GRI Report) and on 
our sustainability portal.

Group management report 
› In the Group management report, we provide in-depth information about the 
Commerzbank Group’s performance in the 2023 financial year and about the 
macroeconomic and sector-specific conditions and their impact on 
Commerzbank’s business activities. We also describe the outlook for the 
anticipated performance of the Commerzbank Group in 2024 and overall 
conditions expected. 
› In the 2023 financial year, Commerzbank increased its consolidated profit by 
more than 50% to €2.2bn. The Bank benefited from strong customer business 
and persistently high interest rates. The loan portfolio proved to be very 
robust, even in what is still a difficult economic environment. High provisions 
for foreign currency mortgage loans at mBank had a negative impact. The 
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio improved to 14.7% during the year.

Structure and organisation 
 
Commerzbank is the leading bank for SMEs (the Mittelstand) and 
a partner to some 25,500 corporate client groups and almost 11 
million private and small-business customers in Germany. The 
Bank offers a comprehensive portfolio of financial services in two 
business segments – Private and Small-Business Customers and 
Corporate Clients.  
In its corporate client business, Commerzbank focuses on 
German SMEs, large companies and institutional customers. In 
international business, the Bank supports clients that have a 
connection to Germany, Austria and/or Switzerland or belong to 
future-orientated industries. In the Private and Small-Business 
Customers segment, the Bank serves its customers through the 
Commerzbank and comdirect brands: via online and mobile 
channels, in the advisory centre and personally in its branches. 
The Polish subsidiary mBank is an innovative digital bank. It 
serves around 5.8 million private and corporate customers, mainly 
in Poland but also in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.  
The two segments Private and Small-Business Customers and 
Corporate Clients are each managed by a member of the Board of 
Managing Directors. All staff and management functions are 
contained 
in 
Group 
Management: 
Group 
Audit, 
Group 
Communications, Group Finance, Group Human Resources, Group 
Investor Relations, Group Legal, Group Research, Group Strategy, 
Transformation & Sustainability, Group Tax, Group Treasury and 
the central risk functions. The support functions, including in 
particular IT, organisational, security and processing services, are 
provided by Group Services. The staff, management and support 
functions are combined in the Others and Consolidation division 
for external reporting purposes. 
On the domestic market, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is 
headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, from where it manages its 
branch network and its advisory centre. Its most important 
German subsidiary is Commerz Real AG. Outside of Germany, as 
at the reporting date Commerzbank has – including through 
mBank in Poland – 4 material subsidiaries, 15 operational foreign 
branches and 27 representative offices in over 40 countries and is 
represented in all major financial centres, such as London, New 
York, Tokyo and Singapore. In these locations we offer tailor-made 
solutions for local corporate and institutional customers and 
support local export-oriented companies worldwide. However, the 
focus of the Bank’s international activities is on Europe. 
Commerzbank prepares Group financial statements which, in 
addition to Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft as operating lead 
company, incorporate all material subsidiaries over which the 
Bank exercises control. The financial year is the calendar year. 
Objectives and strategy 
 
Now that we have successfully implemented a far-reaching 
restructuring of Commerzbank and set up a new business model 
with the “Strategy 2024” programme, our text task is to establish 
our new business model in the market and thereby further 
improve our profitability. Our “Strategy 2027” programme, which 
was approved at the end of 2023, will seamlessly build on the 
successes of our strategic direction up to now. 
We will enlarge our earnings base, further improve our cost 
income ratio and increase our return on equity. In this way, we will 
create value for our shareholders and extend our position as a 
formative force in the German banking market. The overall aim is 
to increase net income to €3.4bn by 2027 and to improve the 
return on equity ratio (RoTE) to more than 11%. In this way the 
Bank will earn its cost of capital. The intention is for an increase in 
net commission income to contribute to this in particular, while no 
further increase in net interest income from its very high level in 
2023 is expected up to 2027. Financial management will continue 
to be based on the cost income ratio, which is expected to improve 
to around 55% by 2027. 
A target of 13.5% is set for the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. 
The Bank plans to return more capital to its shareholders: The 
payout ratio for 2024 should be at least 70% as defined by the 
capital return policy, but not more than the consolidated profit 
after deduction of AT1 coupons. The aim for 2025 to 2027 is to 
attain a payout ratio of more than 50%, but not more than the 
consolidated profit after deduction of AT1 coupons. The Bank 
confirms its target to distribute 50% of its consolidated profit for 
the past year, after deduction of AT1 coupon payments, via a 
dividend payment and an applied-for share buyback of up to 
€600m. It is planned that this share buyback takes place prior to 
the Annual General Meeting in 2024.  
Our “Strategy 2027” programme is based on three pillars: 
growth, excellence, and responsibility. The Bank intends to 
support its customers with relevant products and solutions and to 
further improve the customer experience across all channels, i.e. 
in branches, in the advisory centre, and via digital access.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
The revenue base will be strengthened primarily through 
expanded fee business. To increase its efficiency, the Bank will 
focus on simplifying digital processes. The cost income ratio is 
also to be improved on this basis. Sustainability continues to be a 
key component of the strategy. The Bank will continue to actively 
shape the sustainable transformation of the German economy. 
Employees are crucial for successfully implementing the strategy. 
Therefore, the Bank will strengthen its position as an attractive 
employer for its employees and talents. 
Private and Small-Business Customers: Asset and Wealth 
Management as well as comdirect as driver of growth 
In the Private and Small-Business Customers (PSBC) segment, the 
range of optimised and digital banking solutions is being 
expanded for the Bank’s almost 11 million private and small-
business customers in Germany. With its holistic approach and its 
two brands, Commerzbank and comdirect, it will meet all 
customer needs – whether online or mobile, in its advisory centre 
or in person in around 400 branches. Commerzbank wants to offer 
every customer the right model for their everyday banking needs. 
To this end, it will, among other things, further develop its account 
and card offerings as well as its payment transaction solutions. As 
a premium provider, Commerzbank aims to be the first point of 
contact for discerning customers. It will consistently expand its 
offering with a focus on securities and the lending business. 
Commerzbank sees opportunities particularly in asset and wealth 
management. 
These activities are being expanded through tailor-made and 
holistic offers for premium customers, for example with Yellowfin, 
a recently spun off asset management company. Commerzbank 
will in future use a holistic advisory tool to advise its wealth 
management customers, and it will consider not only liquid but 
also illiquid assets. The Bank wants to increase its customer 
growth among small-business customers while focusing on 
specific target groups. comdirect will strengthen its position as the 
digital primary bank with an expanded product range and its 
excellent brokerage platform. With its attractive and digital 
business model, mBank will build on its leading position among 
private customers. 
Corporate clients: building on our leading market position 
As the leading German Mittelstandsbank, Commerzbank will 
continue to provide close support to its corporate clients in their 
ongoing transformations. The Bank will continue to drive forward 
its strategy to date in the corporate customer business through 
targeted investments in products and digital solutions up to 2027.  
Commerzbank will therefore strengthen its transaction banking 
by investing in new systems and technologies and thereby secure 
its leading position in payment transactions and in the German 
trade finance business. In international business, the Bank 
supports clients that have a connection to Germany, Austria and/or 
Switzerland or belong to future-orientated industries. In its 
lending business, its focus is on growth in Germany and on 
financing green infrastructure projects worldwide. Commerzbank 
will rely on its centres of competence for renewable energies in 
Hamburg, Singapore and New York to achieve this. In the capital 
markets area, the Bank wants to expand its offering in the digital 
currency business and to open its central online trading platform 
to additional asset classes. Another focus will be on expanding the 
bonds business. 
 
 
 
Full details of our “Strategy 2027” programme can be found on 
the Commerzbank website. 
Corporate management 
 
Corporate management in the Commerzbank Group is based on a 
value-oriented steering concept. This concept is focused on 
ensuring that the risks entered by the business units are in line 
with the external and internal guidelines on risk-bearing capacity 
and on striving to achieve an appropriate return over the long term 
on the capital employed. In this respect, the Bank regularly 
monitors the allocation of scarce resources to business units and 
actively adapts its business strategy to changing market 
circumstances in order to boost the enterprise value over the long 
term.  
The annual planning process is a key corporate management 
tool. In this process, the Board of Managing Directors sets targets 
for the business units based on the business strategy. Existing 
resources such as capital and risk limits are allocated to the 
segments in a way that reflects the targets and risk profiles. The 
segments operationalise the targets based on the business 
strategy and the results of the planning process. The Board of 
Managing Directors carries out regular checks to ensure that 
business planning is being followed. This ensures that any 
deviations are identified at an early stage through monthly 
management reporting, and corrective measures are taken.

In order to manage the Group and its segments, the Bank uses 
the standard controlling indicators described below, which cover 
all the essential dimensions of Group management. Their 
development is monitored as part of regular management 
reporting. 
The management of the Bank takes account of both pillars of 
capital adequacy requirements. To ensure internal risk-bearing 
capacity at all times, planning includes allocating economic capital 
to the segments according to type of risk. The average capital 
employed in the segments is calculated based on the average 
segmented risk-weighted assets. At Group level, Common Equity 
Tier 1 (CET1) capital is shown. The reconciliation of average 
capital employed in the segments to the Group’s CET1 capital is 
carried out in Others and Consolidation. The Common Equity Tier 
1 ratio is a key indicator for the Bank in capital management.  
The key figures used for measuring success in the corporate 
management process are operating profit/loss and group 
profit/loss after tax and non-controlling interests, along with the 
cost income and return on equity ratios. The cost income ratio is 
used to assess cost efficiency and is defined as the ratio of 
operating expenses to income before the risk result. The cost 
income ratio is calculated in two variants: with and without the 
inclusion of compulsory contributions in the item “costs”. 
Segment return on equity is calculated as the ratio of operating 
profit/loss or pre-tax profit/loss to the average amount of 
regulatory capital employed. It shows the return on the equity 
invested in a given business segment. As is standard for value-
based management concepts, the target minimum return on 
capital employed is derived from the expected return on the 
capital market. Here the focus at Group level is on the return on 
tangible equity. The Economic Value Added, which was reported 
as a performance indicator for corporate management in 2022, 
was replaced by the return on net equity in the financial year in 
line with the industry-standard reporting of European banks. The 
Economic Value Added is still displayed as a message for internal 
purposes. 
The operating result and the return on equity are used to 
measure the Group’s performance. The Group’s return on equity is 
the ratio of the consolidated profit after tax and non-controlling 
interests to the average CET1 capital of the Group.  
The calculation of the capital cost rate is based on the 
Bank’s strategic target return on tangible equity and the capital 
market-oriented Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and is 
subject to an annual review. Commerzbank currently calculates its 
post-tax cost of capital to be 10.0%. 
As Group figures, the controlling data listed above form part of 
a system of other segment-specific data that vary from segment to 
segment depending on the business strategy.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Important staffing and business 
policy events 
 
A report on important staffing changes at management level and 
special business policy events during the past financial year and 
the first few weeks of the current year is provided below. 
Over the course of the year under review, there were changes 
in the composition of both the Supervisory Board and the Board of 
Managing Directors. Commerzbank has achieved further success 
and progress with its sustainability strategy. At the end of March 
2023, its CO2 reduction calculations were reviewed and validated 
by the Science Based Targets initiative, one of the leading 
international standard setters, and the Bank has joined the 
Partnership 
for 
Carbon 
Accounting 
Financials 
(PCAF) 
as 
announced in September 2023. The 2023 stress test conducted by 
the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank 
(ECB) showed that Commerzbank is well positioned even under 
simulated 
stress 
conditions. 
The 
bank-specific 
capital 
requirements set by the ECB for 2024 as part of the Supervisory 
Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) also clearly confirm once 
again that Commerzbank is well positioned in terms of its 
capitalisation.  
In order to give its shareholders an appropriate share in its 
success, the Bank successfully completed its first share buyback 
programme in the year under review and launched another share 
buyback programme at the beginning of January 2024. At the 
beginning of the current year, Commerzbank decided on two 
investments in connection with the “Strategy 2027” programme 
published in November 2023. In addition to announcing a joint 
venture with Global Payments Inc., a leading global provider of 
financial technologies and software solutions, it agreed – subject 
to the necessary regulatory approvals – to acquire a majority stake 
in Aquila Capital Investmentgesellschaft mbH, an asset manager, 
in order to accelerate its growth in the sustainability business. The 
Bank also adapted its compliance function to the regulatory 
environment in the 2023 financial year. 
Commerzbank’s Annual General Meeting: new 
Supervisory Board members elected 
At the virtual Annual General Meeting of Commerzbank on 31 May 
2023, the shareholders, as proposed, elected Harald Christ, 
Dr. Frank Czichowski, Sabine U. Dietrich, Dr. Jutta A. Dönges, 
Burkhard Keese, Daniela Mattheus, Caroline Seifert, Dr. Gertrude 
Tumpel-Gugerell, Prof. Dr. Jens Weidmann and Frank Westhoff to 
the Supervisory Board of the Bank by a large majority.  
The election of the employee representatives on the 
Supervisory Board had already taken place at the start of 2023. At 
its first meeting following the Annual General Meeting, the 
Supervisory 
Board 
elected 
Prof. Dr. Jens Weidmann 
as 
its 
Chairman. For full details of the Supervisory Board and the 
composition of the individual committees, please refer to the 
Commerzbank website. 
Changes in the Board of Managing Directors of 
Commerzbank 
At its meeting on 11 September 2023, the Supervisory Board of 
Commerzbank appointed Bernhard Spalt to the Board of 
Managing Directors of Commerzbank as Chief Risk Officer with 
effect from 1 January 2024. Bernhard Spalt succeeded Dr. Marcus 
Chromik, who left Commerzbank at the end of 2023 – as had 
already been announced in July 2022. As a former member of the 
Management Board of Erste Group and Erste Bank Austria, 
Bernhard Spalt has many years of experience in all areas of risk 
management. He was also Chief Executive Officer of Erste Group 
Bank AG from 2020 to 2022. 
In mid-February 2024, Dr. Jörg Oliveri del Castillo-Schulz 
informed the Supervisory Board that he will not renew his contract 
with the Management Board, which will run until the end of 
September 2024. The Supervisory Board has started an orderly 
succession process. 
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validates 
Commerzbank’s CO2 emissions reduction 
targets 
In September 2020, Commerzbank became the first German bank to 
join the SBTi and developed science-based targets to reduce the 
financed emissions attributable to the CO2-intensive sectors in its 
portfolio. The initiative is a global body enabling businesses to set 
their emissions reduction targets in line with the latest climate 
science. It supports companies to reduce CO2 emissions significantly 
by 2030 and consequently move to net-zero emissions by 2050. 
Our CO2 emissions reduction calculations were reviewed and 
validated by the Science Based Targets initiative, one of the 
leading standard-setting bodies, at the end of March 2023. 
Commerzbank is the first German bank with SBTi-validated CO2 
emissions reduction targets. 
The SBTi targets are a core element of Commerzbank’s 
sustainability strategy. The Bank has, among other things, defined 
specific CO2 reduction targets for seven emissions-intensive 
sectors. These are: power generation, retail mortgage financing, 
commercial real estate financing, automotive manufacturing, 
aviation, cement, and iron and steel.

Commerzbank joins the Partnership for Carbon 
Accounting Financials (PCAF) 
As announced in September 2023, Commerzbank has joined the 
Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) – an 
initiative of more than 400 financial institutions worldwide. PCAF 
members are committed to reporting the CO2 emissions associated 
with loans and investments across the industry using a consistent 
methodology. These financed emissions are a crucial part of the 
carbon footprint of banks. The PCAF approach enables 
stakeholders to compare this carbon footprint of banks with each 
other. This makes reduction targets and progress more 
transparent. The PCAF complements Commerzbank’s steering 
elements, through which it aims to steer its sector portfolios 
towards the Paris climate target.  
In 2023 we also switch our method of calculating portfolio 
intensities to the internationally recognised PCAF standard. In the 
course of applying this standard, we additionally recalculated the 
starting point in the kick-off year 2021 and determined new target 
values for 2030. The targets remained as ambitious as before, or 
became slightly more ambitious, because another sector (cement) 
moved from a 1.8°C pathway to a 1.5°C pathway. The SBTi has not 
yet finally approved the adjusted targets. 
Stress test by the European Banking Authority 
and the European Central Bank demonstrates 
Commerzbank’s high level of resilience 
Commerzbank once again demonstrated its resilience and 
significantly improved its performance, despite more demanding 
conditions, in the 2023 stress test conducted by the European 
Banking Authority and the European Central Bank, the results of 
which were published at the end of July 2023. In what is called the 
adverse stress test scenario, which simulates a severe economic 
crisis, the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1 ratio) stands at 9.5% 
as at the end of the observation period in 2025. Given still more 
challenging assumptions, for example in terms of a massive and 
prolonged economic slump in Germany and sharply rising interest 
rates, Commerzbank’s CET1 ratio decreased by 464 basis points 
over the stress period. In the previous test in 2021, the capital 
ratio had fallen by 502 basis points to 8.2%. 
SREP capital requirements for Commerzbank 
set for 2024 – distance from the MDA threshold 
remains comfortable 
At the beginning of December 2023, the European Central Bank 
(ECB) set the bank-specific capital requirements for the 
Commerzbank Group for 2024, as part of the supervisory review 
and evaluation process (SREP). The additional capital adequacy 
requirement under Pillar 2 (P2R) increases slightly (by 25 basis 
points) to 2.25% of total capital, of which at least 1.27% must be 
covered by Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Previously, the 
requirement was 1.13% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. The 
SREP decision replaces the previous SREP decision with effect 
from 1 January 2024. 
The requirements are fully reflected in Commerzbank’s 
strategic planning and policy on returning capital. With a CET1 
ratio of 14.7% as of December 2023, the Bank is well above the 
MDA threshold. 
Commerzbank carries out share buyback 
programmes 
In June 2023, Commerzbank completed the first share buyback 
programme in the amount of €122m, which had been approved by 
the ECB and the German Finance Agency at the end of April 2023. 
This share buyback programme supplemented the dividend of 
€0.20 per share that the Annual General Meeting had approved on 
31 May 2023.  
At the end of December 2023, Commerzbank received approval 
from the European Central Bank for a new share buyback 
programme with a volume of up to €600m. With that approval and 
the approval of the German Finance Agency, all of the approval 
requirements for a share buyback have been met. The Board of 
Managing Directors decided on this basis at the beginning of 
January 2024 to implement the share buyback. The repurchased 
shares of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft will be cancelled. 
Commerzbank and Global Payments Inc. 
establish a joint venture 
In mid-January 2024, Commerzbank and Global Payments Inc., a 
leading global provider of financial technologies and software 
solutions, announced a joint venture to offer digital payment 
products to small-business customers in Germany. The new 
company, Commerz Globalpay GmbH, is expected to launch on 
the market in the first half of 2024. Merchants will be offered a 
wide range of digital solutions that will work across different 
channels.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
190 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
This range of services from a single source will enable small-
business customers to manage and expand their businesses more 
efficiently. 
Commerz Globalpay GmbH will offer digital payment solutions. 
These will include Global Payments Inc.’s smartphone-based 
payment application that will enable merchants to accept mobile 
payments without a separate card reader, as well as modern card 
terminals and eCommerce/mobile payment solutions that will 
ensure a seamless, integrated customer experience. Business 
customers will also have access to cloud-based point-of-sale 
software, a customer loyalty programme and an analytics and 
customer engagement platform. 
Commerzbank acquires majority stake in Aquila 
Capital Investmentgesellschaft mbH 
With its acquisition of a majority stake in the asset manager Aquila 
Capital Investmentgesellschaft mbH, which was announced in 
mid-January 
2024, 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft 
is 
accelerating its growth in the sustainability business. Its 
acquisition of 74.9% of the shares in this investment company, 
which specialises in essential real assets such as renewable 
energies and sustainable infrastructure projects, had been agreed 
with the Aquila Group. 25.1% of the shares remain with the 
previous parent company, the Aquila Group. Aquila Capital 
Investmentgesellschaft mbH is intended to develop, under the 
umbrella of Commerzbank, into a leading asset manager for 
sustainable investment strategies. Together with Commerz Real 
and Aquila Capital Investmentgesellschaft, Commerzbank will 
significantly advance the energy transition in Germany and 
Europe. The transaction is still subject to the required regulatory 
approvals and is expected to be completed during the second 
quarter of 2024. 
Continuous adaptation of the compliance 
function to the regulatory environment  
In the 2023 financial year, the compliance function once again 
took extensive measures to ensure the appropriate and effective 
management of compliance risks in Germany and abroad. A 
particular challenge was posed by the increasing frequency and 
complexity of new regulations and requirements, particularly 
those relating to sanctions. 
To mitigate the risks, the compliance function draws on the 
governance structures implemented and proven throughout the 
Bank in recent years, the global compliance processes and 
controls and the existing system landscape.  
The arrangements are regularly reviewed across the Bank’s 
businesses and are continuously adapted to the new regulatory 
requirements and changing market standards.  
With regard to the German Corporate Due Diligence in Supply 
Chains Act (LkSG) that entered into force on 1 January 2023, the 
compliance function (acting as global functional lead) fulfils the 
role of the 
second line 
of defence, 
and thus 
defines  
Group-wide minimum standards for the Bank in order to identify 
and prevent breaches of certain human rights and certain 
environmental obligations at (in)direct suppliers and in the Bank’s 
own area of business. To ensure compliance with the LkSG’s 
requirements, the Bank has set up a comprehensive compliance 
programme and is consistently expanding it. In 2023, the focus 
was on the implementation of a global LkSG programme. 
For more information on compliance risks and on integrity and 
compliance at Commerzbank, please see page 256 f. of the Group 
Risk Report and page 72 f. of the combined separate non-financial 
report.

Economic conditions 
 
Economic environment 
The global economy continued to lose momentum in 2023, but 
with strong regional divergences. 
In China, the government’s abrupt departure from its zero-
Covid policy at the end of 2022 boosted the economy in the short 
term. After a noticeable recovery at the beginning of 2023, 
economic growth again slowed noticeably in the spring. The 
recovery was slowed down primarily by problems on the real 
estate market. But a loss of trust in the state’s economic policy due 
to its Covid policy and the restrictions that it had imposed, 
especially on the technology sector, may also have played a role. 
However, with average annual growth of 5.2%, economic growth 
was still significantly higher than it had been in 2022. 
In the USA, the economy performed better than expected, until 
recently. This was primarily due to the unusually expansionary 
financial policy, which prevented the US Federal Reserve’s 
massive policy rate increases (by a total of 525 basis points) from 
having a full impact on the economy. Despite the shortage of 
skilled labour, the economy grew at 2.5% in 2023, which was 
stronger than the long-term average. The fact that the inflation 
rate fell significantly again over the course of the year, despite 
high wage increases, was mainly due to the correction in energy 
prices.  
 
 
 
In contrast to the USA, economic growth came to a standstill in 
the eurozone over the course of the year. On average for the year, 
overall economic output only increased by 0.5%. The sustained 
increase in energy prices came on top of the ECB’s massive 
increase in policy rates (by a total of 450 basis points) since mid of 
2022 and put a strain on private households and companies. Many 
companies were unable to pass on their energy-related higher 
production costs to their customers in full, and this resulted in a 
significant decline in the production of energy-intensive goods.  
The German economy is estimated to have even contracted by 
0.3% in 2023. The energy price shock hit Germany particularly 
hard and prevented its economy from recovering during the first 
half of the year.  
Noticeably increased financing costs and weak demand from 
abroad actually caused its economy to contract during the second 
half of the year. The lower level of economic activity is also 
reflected in its labour market. Employment growth has slowed 
noticeably, and the unemployment rate has again risen slightly. 
Trends on the financial markets in 2023 were dominated by the 
continued tightening of fiscal policies. By the middle of the year, 
and against the background of high inflation, the US Federal 
Reserve raised the target range for the policy rate by a further 100 
basis points to 5.25% – 5.50%. By September, the ECB even 
increased its deposit rate by 250 basis points to 4.0%. The bond 
market initially reacted with significantly rising yields. At their 
peak, 
ten-year 
US 
government 
bonds 
yielded 
5% 
and 
corresponding German government bonds yielded nearly 3%. At 
the turn of the year, speculation about imminent cuts in policy 
rates caused yields to fall significantly again. 
The stock market was surprisingly robust despite the increased 
yields. At the end of the year, many stock market indices were 
close to their historical highs again. The EUR to USD exchange 
rate was volatile, but moved mainly sideways. 
Sector environment 
The difficult economic situation – particularly with regard to 
international trouble spots, high inflation rates and energy costs – 
made 2023 a challenging year for the banking sector. Although 
government measures prevented an economic slump, the negative 
consequences for the economy and society are gradually 
beginning to show. The difficulties of US regional banks in the 
first half of 2023, which were triggered by high write-downs on 
fixed-income securities in their portfolios, have led to doubts in 
confidence in the global banking sector. That also applies to 
Europe, although regulation is tighter here than in the USA. 
According to the Ifo Business Climate Index, business 
expectations in Germany deteriorated over the course of the year. 
Industry, trade and the construction sector were particularly 
affected. The current purchasing managers’ indices for the 
services sector also suggest weak economic development for 
Germany and the rest of the eurozone. Despite recent noticeable 
declines, inflation continues to exceed the target set by the central 
banks. At the same time, the challenging general conditions are 
causing 
considerable 
uncertainty 
among 
companies 
and 
dampening their willingness to invest. Nevertheless, the financial 
markets have so far proven to be very robust. European banks 
have so far not been affected by major defaults.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
According to the European Banking Authority (EBA), banks’ 
profitability improved significantly during 2023 as a result of the 
rise in interest rates over the past year and a half. In the second 
quarter of 2023, the average return on equity reached double-digit 
percentages for the first time since the establishment of the 
European Banking Union. This was primarily due to higher net 
interest margins. According to the Deutsche Bundesbank’s 
analysis, interest rates rose faster and more strongly in the lending 
business than in the deposit business, and this is why net interest 
income proved to be the main driver for the significant increase in 
operating income. European banks also continued to be resilient 
in terms of liquidity and refinancing. The average liquidity 
coverage ratios remain well above the minimum regulatory 
requirements.  
 
 
 
In Germany, according to official insolvency statistics, defaults 
on loan servicing remained at a reasonable level for a long time – 
despite the energy crisis, the Russia-Ukraine war and the sharply 
increased inflation. However, insolvency activity lags around one 
to two years behind economic developments. It is therefore not 
surprising that, according to Creditreform, the number of 
corporate insolvencies increased significantly (by 23.5%) across 
all size classes during the whole of 2023. Medium-sized and large 
companies recorded an above-average increase in insolvencies. 
The retail, catering, freight forwarding, construction and health 
sectors were particularly affected. Further payment defaults are to 
be expected against this background. There is also a risk of loan 
defaults on commercial real estate financing if borrowing rates 
remain at a high level over the long term. At the same time the 
number of business closures also increased. The number of 
companies discontinuing operations completely rose by around 
10% in the first three quarters of 2023 compared with the 
corresponding prior-year period. In contrast, the number of 
consumer insolvencies remained almost unchanged in 2023. The 
resilient labour market had a stabilising effect. However, higher 
default rates cannot be ruled out for consumer loans in the coming 
months. In recent years, many borrowers’ net debt has risen 
markedly in response to very favourable financing conditions. The 
resulting need for value adjustments will affect both retail and 
corporate banking business. 
The long-lived boom in the local residential property market 
came to an abrupt end due to the sharp rise in mortgage interest 
rates. Many prospective buyers are unlikely to be able to afford 
initial financing at current prices, especially as the persistently 
high level of core inflation is continuing to put a strain on the 
budgets of many households. However, long fixed-interest periods 
on existing properties instead of variable-rate mortgage loans, as 
well as the preferrence of annuity loans instead of bullet mortgage 
loans, reduce risks. As a result, when fixed-interest periods expire, 
follow-up financing costs are at present generally not much higher 
than in the previous period. More extensive defaults on existing 
mortgages are therefore not to be expected in the foreseeable 
future. Any considerable fall in house prices is also rather 
improbable on a nationwide average. That is because the 
continuing shortage of affordable housing, the relatively low 
ownership rate compared with other countries, and the 
reallocation of assets against a backdrop of a high level of 
economic uncertainty and reduced monetary stability are 
supporting the residential real estate market. Nevertheless, new 
business in residential mortgage loans to private households 
dropped sharply over the course of 2023, and new business in 
consumer loans also fell. New business declined slightly for loans 
to non-financial companies and more significantly for loans to the 
self-employed.  
As a neighbour of Ukraine, Poland has been affected indirectly 
by the war, with the adverse economic effects also having a 
negative impact on its financial sector. Poland’s gross domestic 
product lost significant momentum in the first half of 2023. 
Despite these unfavourable conditions, the Polish banking sector 
proved to be robust in the assessment of financial stability. Overall, 
there were trends towards consolidation, which will continue. In 
the meantime, the economic outlook has brightened significantly 
again, driven primarily by strong consumer spending. Risks result 
primarily from unsecured consumer loans and residential 
mortgage loans. There are currently numerous pending lawsuits 
from private customers relating to foreign currency mortgage 
loans with indexing clauses. Following the implementation by 
national courts of rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), 
additional provisions may become necessary for foreign currency 
loan portfolios. “Credit holidays” under which interest payments 
can be temporarily suspended also have a negative impact on 
income in the Polish banking sector.

Financial performance, assets, 
liabilities and financial position 
 
The 2023 financial year was a very successful one for 
Commerzbank. Double-digit income growth was recorded in 2023 
despite substantial charges at our Polish subsidiary mBank. This 
exceptionally strong income momentum was driven by strong 
customer business and the tailwind provided by interest rate 
increases on the part of both the ECB and the Polish central bank. 
The Commerzbank Group recorded an operating profit of 
€3,421m for the year under review, compared with €2,099m in the 
previous 
year. 
The 
consolidated 
profit 
attributable 
to 
Commerzbank shareholders and investors in additional equity 
components for the period under review was €2,224m. 
 
 
 
Total assets of the Commerzbank Group as at 31 December 
2023 were €517.2bn, compared with €477.4bn at the end of 2022. 
The 8.3% increase resulted in particular from inflows of liquidity 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
collateralised 
securities 
repurchase 
transactions. The increase in risk-weighted assets (RWA) to 
€175.1bn was mainly due to higher risk-weighted assets relating 
to credit risks. Common Equity Tier 1 capital was €25.7bn and the 
corresponding Common Equity Tier 1 ratio 14.7%.  
Explanations regarding changes or amendments to the 
accounting and measurement methods can be found in Notes 2 
and 4 to the Group financial statements. 
Income statement of the Commerzbank Group 
The individual items in the income statement were as follows in 
2023:  
Net interest income was €8,368m in the period under review, 
compared with €6,459m in the previous year. The significant 
increase of 29.6% was attributable to a considerable rise in 
income 
from 
interest-bearing 
business 
in 
both 
customer 
segments. mBank was largely responsible for the increase in net 
interest income in the Private and Small-Business Customers 
segment. The significantly higher average central bank rate level 
in Poland had a particularly positive impact. As a result, deposit 
business made the largest contribution to mBank’s sharp rise in 
net interest income.  
However, the development of the interest-bearing business in 
Germany was determined by offsetting effects. While the 
turnaround in interest rates resulted in additional income from 
deposits, the loss of one-off income due to unscheduled 
repayments of retail mortgage financing in the previous year led to 
lower net interest income. In addition, interest rate model 
adjustments as part of the maturity transformation of deposits in 
the Private and Small-Business Customers segment resulted in 
compensation payments between the segment and Group Treasury 
when adjusting model tranches, and this had a negative impact on 
earnings in the Private and Small-Business Customers segment. 
These two offsetting effects balanced each other out in the 
Group’s net interest income. Net interest income in the Corporate 
Clients segment was also higher than the prior-year level. Here, 
the Mittelstand division showed a clearly positive earnings trend 
year on year. While income from lending business decreased, the 
Cash Management and Financial Markets divisions benefited from 
a marked rise in deposit income. The increase in net interest 
income in Others and Consolidation was mainly due to a higher 
positive result from Group Treasury from short-term and floating-
rate instruments with negative offsetting interest rate effects from 
banking book derivatives due to the marked rise in interest rates. 
The change in fair value compensation payments for special 
repayments of retail mortgage financing by customers in the 
Private and Small-Business Customers segment supported the 
increase in net interest income. In addition, interest rate model 
adjustments as part of the maturity transformation of deposits in 
the Private and Small-Business Customers segment resulted in 
compensation payments between Group Treasury and the segment 
when closing model tranches, which led to an increase in earnings 
for Group Treasury. In net interest income at Group level, the 
effects of fair value compensation payments and interest model 
adjustments offset each other. 
Net commission income was 3.8% below the prior-year level at 
€3,386m. In the Private and Small-Business Customers segment, 
transaction-related securities business in particular slightly 
declined in Germany in the period under review because of the 
turnaround in interest rates and the lower market volatility 
compared with the prior year, which was reflected in a slight drop 
in commission income. This could not be offset by higher income 
from payment transactions. mBank also recorded a decline in net 
commission income compared with the prior-year period. In the 
Corporate Clients segment, net commission income was largely 
stable compared with the corresponding prior-year period. The 
decrease in income from international and foreign currency 
business was largely offset by higher income from syndication 
business.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
The net income from financial assets and liabilities measured at 
fair value through profit or loss was €–359m in the reporting 
period, after €451m in the prior-year period. The significant 
decrease was attributable to negative interest effects from banking 
book derivatives caused by the marked rise in interest rates – with 
a corresponding counter-effect on net interest income.

Other profit or loss from financial instruments was €52m in the 
period under review, compared with €–292m in the previous year, 
which included charges against earnings caused by interest and 
repayment deferrals for private real estate financing at mBank. 
Other net income of €–1,055m chiefly reflects provisions of  
€–1,094m in connection with retail mortgage financing in foreign 
currencies at mBank, which were offset only to a small extent by 
write-ups on equity holdings and gains on disposals. 
The risk result of €–618m was significantly better than the 
prior-year figure of €–876m. The decline was primarily 
attributable to effects related to the Russia-Ukraine war in the 
prior year. The loan loss provisions required in the Private and 
Small-Business Customers segment for the period under review 
increased compared with the prior-year period – particularly at 
mBank, while the risk result in the Corporate Clients segment was 
significantly lower than the prior-year result, which had primarily 
been impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war. The secondary effects 
top-level adjustment (TLA), which had been recognised in 2022, 
continued to be needed in 2023 in view of the crisis-related 
economic uncertainty. As at 31 December 2023, the total for the 
TLA for secondary effects stood at €453m, compared with €482m 
in the previous year. Further information on the TLA can be found 
on page 233 ff. of the Group risk report. 
Operating expenses amounted to €6,006m in the period under 
review, 2.8% higher than in the prior-year period despite the 
inflationary pressure. In the case of personnel costs, which at 
€3,562m were 4.3% above the previous year’s level, cost-
increasing effects – in particular deferrals for profit-related 
variable remuneration, expenses for the inflation adjustment 
premium as well as general salary adjustments – could only be 
partially compensated by effects from the reduction of full-time 
staff. On the other hand, operating expenses, including 
depreciation of fixed assets and amortisation of other intangible 
assets, were at the same level as in the prior year at €2,444m. 
While advertising and travel expenses in particular increased 
compared with the prior-year period, scheduled amortisation of 
software and expenses connected with the streamlining of the 
branch network decreased. 
Compulsory contributions, which are reported separately, fell 
by €227m to €415m. The reduction of 35.3% resulted from a 
lower European banking levy due to the decision taken by the 
Single Resolution Fund of the Banking Union to reduce the target 
volume for 2023 because of slower growth than expected in 
European covered deposits, as well as from the lapse of the levy 
on mBank that had been required in the previous year to 
supplement the Polish deposit protection scheme. In addition, the 
utilisation of irrevocable payment commitments for the European 
banking levy had a corresponding effect.

Restructuring expenses of €18m during the period under 
review affected earnings performance. These mainly related to the 
implementation of the “Strategy 2024” programme and resulted in 
particular from the recognition of restructuring provisions in 
connection with property matters. 
The pre-tax profit was €3.403m, compared with €2,005m in the 
prior-year period. Tax expenses of €1,188m were reported for the 
2023 financial year. This resulted mainly from the taxation of the 
positive result for the financial year as well as provisions in 
connection with foreign currency mortgage loans at mBank, which 
were largely not deductible for tax purposes. 
The consolidated profit after tax was €2,214m, compared with 
€1,393m in the previous year.  
 
 
 
Net of non-controlling interests, a consolidated profit of 
€2,224m was attributable to Commerzbank shareholders and 
investors in additional equity components for the 2023 financial 
year, compared with €1,435m in the previous year. 
Against the backdrop of positive results for the 2023 financial 
year in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB), the 
plan is to service all capital instruments issued by Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft for the 2023 financial year. We will propose to 
the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of €0.35 per share be 
distributed for 2023. In addition, Commerzbank has launched a 
share buyback programme worth up to €600m in accordance with 
its capital return policy – following approval from the ECB and the 
German Finance Agency. 
Total comprehensive income, which includes both consolidated 
profit/loss and other comprehensive income for the period, came 
to €2,644m in 2023, compared with €1,263m in the previous year.  
Other comprehensive income of €429m was comprised of the 
sum of changes in the revaluation reserve (FVOCImR) (€338m), 
the cash flow hedge reserve (€94m), the currency translation 
reserve (€122m), the change in companies accounted for using 
the equity method (€1m), the change from the remeasurement of 
defined benefit plans not recognised in the income statement 
(€7m), the change in own credit spreads of liabilities FVO not 
recognised in the income statement (€–131m), and the change in 
remeasurement effects from net investment hedges (€–2m). 
Further information on other comprehensive income can be found 
on page 269 of the Group financial statements. 
Operating profit per share was €2.75 and earnings per share 
€1.63. The comparable figures in the prior-year period were €1.68 
and €0.99 respectively. The cost income ratio was 57.4% 
excluding 
compulsory 
contributions 
and 
61.4% 
including 
compulsory contributions. The corresponding figures for the 
previous year were 61.8% and 68.6% respectively. 
Balance sheet of the Commerzbank Group 
Total assets of the Commerzbank Group as at 31 December 2023 
were €517.2bn, up 8.3% compared with year-end 2022.  
Cash on hand and cash on demand rose by €17.9bn to 
€93.1bn. The strong growth on the 2022 year-end balance was 
attributable to an increase in deposits held with central banks due 
to inflows of liquidity. 
Financial assets at amortised cost increased by €2.5bn to 
€298.7bn compared with the end of 2022. Around 60% of the 
increase was attributable to loans and receivables – mainly from 
financial service providers, public-sector borrowers and credit 
institutions, and including regional lending business, special 
financing, renewable energy financing and mBank’s corporate 
customer business. Securitised debt instruments increased by 
€1.0bn, mainly at mBank. 
Financial assets in the fair value OCI category were €40.1bn, 
up €5.3bn from the end of 2022. The increase of 15.1% mainly 
resulted from a higher volume of debt securities in connection 
with liquidity management.  
At €48.4bn, financial assets mandatorily measured at fair value 
through profit or loss were €18.4bn higher than at the end of the 
previous year. The increase was primarily attributable to an 
expansion of collateralised securities repurchase agreements. In 
this regard, loans to and claims on banks and financial service 
providers rose by €19.2bn in total, while loans to and claims on 
central banks fell by €1.9bn.  
Financial assets held for trading were €28.3bn at the reporting 
date, €5.2bn lower than at the end of 2022. While positive fair 
values – from both interest and currency-related products – 
decreased significantly by a total of €5.8bn, securitised debt 
instruments (with a volume of €2.2bn) were €0.6bn lower than at 
the end of 2022. 
Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups were 
€0.1bn, compared with €0.2bn at the end of 2022. The decrease 
was primarily due to sales.

1 Figures adjusted due to restatements (see Group financial statements, Note 4). 
 
On the liabilities side, financial liabilities at amortised cost were up 
€29.4bn to €419.8bn compared with the end of the previous year. 
The increase versus year-end 2022 was attributable to a marked 
rise of €26.9bn in deposits and other liabilities in the Corporate 
Clients segment and the German retail banking business. Debt 
securities issued increased by €2.5bn compared with the end of 
the previous year in connection with the new issue of Pfandbriefe. 
Financial liabilities under the fair value option amounted to 
€36.9bn on the reporting date and were thus up €11.9bn 
compared with the end of 2022. The increase resulted primarily 
from new issues of bonds and an expansion of the repo business. 
Financial liabilities held for trading were €18.9bn, down 
€5.8bn compared with the end of 2022. The decrease was due to 
the negative fair values of derivative financial instruments, 
especially interest-rate-related and currency-related derivative 
transactions, which fell in total by €5.6bn.  
Provisions increased by €0.1bn year on year to €3.6bn. The 
increase was primarily due to higher provisions for legal risks and 
provisions 
for 
pensions. 
In 
contrast, 
the 
provisions 
for 
restructuring were significantly lower than at the end of the 
previous year. Contingent liabilities and lending commitments 
totalled €128.0bn, the same level as at the end of the previous 
year. Further information regarding contingent liabilities and 
lending commitments can be found in Note 56 to the Group 
Financial Statements. 
Equity 
The equity capital attributable to Commerzbank shareholders 
reported in the balance sheet on 31 December 2023 was €28.9bn, 
up 7.2% compared with year-end 2022. Further information on 
the change in equity can be found on page 272 ff. of the Group 
financial statements. 
Risk-weighted assets were €175.1bn as at 31 December 2023 
and thus €6.4bn higher than at year-end 2022. This change was 
primarily attributable to an increase in risk-weighted assets from 
credit risks. The higher credit risk was mainly attributable to 
increases from the anticipation of effects from model adjustments, 
including under the “IRB Repair” programme set up by the 
banking supervisory authority, and from a higher volume of 
utilisations, commitments and securities repurchase transactions. 
Three new securitisation transactions in the first, third and fourth 
quarters of 2023 had a countervailing effect to an extent. Higher 
risk-weighted assets from market risk resulted mainly from 
increased currency risks from tighter regulation in the context of 
correlated currencies and from position changes. The inclusion of 
the increased income in 2023 as part of the annual update of the 
three-year time series (standardised approach) resulted in an 
increase in risk-weighted assets from operational risks. 
As at the reporting date, Common Equity Tier 1 capital was 
€25.7bn, compared with €23.9bn as at 31 December 2022. The 
positive effects on Common Equity Tier 1 capital resulted primarily 
from the net profit or loss for 2023, taking the accruals for 
dividends, share buybacks and AT1 interest into account.

A further increase in CET1 is due to lower regulatory 
deductions and/or adjustments and an improvement in Other 
comprehensive income. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 
14.7%, compared with 14.1% in the previous year. The Tier 1 
ratio was 16.5% as at the reporting date, compared with 16.0% as 
at the end of 2022. 
 
 
 
Tier 2 capital increased by €0.1bn to €4.9bn compared with 
31 December 2022. New issues increased Tier 2 capital by €0.9bn, 
while amortisation, maturity and currency effects as well as the 
termination of a bond reduced Tier 2 capital by €0.9bn. The total 
capital ratio (with transitional provisions) was 19.3% as at the 
reporting date, compared with 18.9% as at the end of 2022. Own 
funds increased by €1.9bn year on year to €33.9bn as at 
31 December 2023. 
The leverage ratio, which is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by 
leverage ratio exposure, was 4.9%. 
Funding and liquidity of the 
Commerzbank Group 
The liquidity management of the Commerzbank Group is the 
responsibility of Group Treasury, which is represented in all major 
Group locations in Germany and abroad and has reporting lines in 
all subsidiaries. 
Liquidity 
management 
comprises 
both 
operational 
and 
strategic 
components. 
Operational 
liquidity 
management 
encompasses management of daily payment inflows and outflows, 
planning for payment flows expected in the short term and 
management of access to central banks. The division is also 
responsible for access to unsecured and secured sources of 
funding in the money and capital markets and the management of 
the liquidity reserve portfolio. Strategic liquidity management 
involves managing maturity profiles for liquidity-relevant assets 
and liabilities within specified limits and corridors. Additional 
information on this subject can be found in the “Liquidity risk” 
section of the Group risk report. 
Guidelines for the funding profile and funds are derived from 
the business strategy and reflect risk tolerance. The Group’s 
funding is appropriately diversified in terms of investor groups, 
regions, products and currencies. Top-level decisions about 
liquidity management are taken by the Group Asset Liability 
Committee (ALCO), which usually meets monthly.  
The quantification and limitation of liquidity risks are carried 
out via an internal model in which expected cash inflows are 
compared against expected cash outflows. The limits set are 
monitored by the independent risk function. ALCO and the Board 
of Managing Directors receive regular reports on the liquidity risk 
situation. 
 
 
1 Based on reported figures. 
 
In the 2023 reporting period, the money and capital markets were 
influenced in particular by the Russia-Ukraine war, persistent 
economic uncertainties, inflation exceeding the central banks’ 
targets and expectations of possible interest rate cuts by the Fed 
and the ECB in the current year.  
Commerzbank’s liquidity and solvency were assured at all 
times. Furthermore, the Bank’s liquidity management is always 
able to respond promptly to new market circumstances.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
The Commerzbank Group raised €10.1bn in long-term funding 
on the capital market during the year under review. 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft issued a total of five 
Pfandbrief benchmark transactions with a total volume of €5.1bn 
and terms of between 2.5 and 10 years. The average re-offer 
spread was nine basis points above the swap mid-rate. 
In the unsecured segment, Commerzbank issued its fourth own 
green bond for €600m as a non-preferred senior bond. The bond 
has a term of 5.5 years with a call date in March 2028 and a 
coupon of 5.25% per annum. Furthermore, the Bank issued a non-
preferred senior bond with a volume of €750m and a term of 
seven years. The bond is callable after six years, and the re-offer 
spread is 240 basis points above the swap mid-rate. A further two 
bonds with a total volume of CHF 325m were also issued. In 
addition, Commerzbank has issued two subordinated Tier 2 SGD 
bonds with a total volume of SGD 600m and maturities in 
May 2033 and April 2034 respectively, call options from February 
to May 2028 and April 2029 respectively, and fixed interest rates 
of 5.7% and 6.5% respectively until the final call redemption 
dates in May 2028 and April 2029 respectively. It has also issued a 
bond with a volume of €500m that matures in October 2033 and 
has a call option from July to October 2028 and a fixed interest 
rate of 6.75% until the final call redemption date in October 2028. 
Secured and unsecured private placements with a combined 
volume of around €1.5bn were also issued. 
As at the end of December 2023, Commerzbank still had 
€3.5bn in funds from the Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing 
Operations III programme (TLTRO III). 
At the beginning of September, mBank issued a €750m green  
non-preferred senior bond with a term of four years and a call date 
in September 2026. The bond bears interest at 8.375% per 
annum. In addition, a credit linked note was issued for the 
equivalent of approximately €160m. 
Deposits in December 2023 compared with December 2022 on 
the basis of the monthly average showed a positive trend. In 
December 2023, private and business customers had deposits of 
€202bn (December 2022: €186bn), with more than 90% of 
domestic deposits protected. In the Corporate Clients segment, 
deposits amounted to €98bn in December 2023 (December 2022: 
€94 bn); more than 60% of them were protected. 
 
 
 
At the end of 2023, the Bank had a liquidity reserve of €134.3bn in 
the form of highly liquid assets. The liquidity reserve portfolio 
works as a buffer in stress situations. It is funded in line with the 
liquidity risk appetite to ensure that it is kept at the required size 
throughout the entire reserve period stipulated by the Board of 
Managing Directors.  
Part of this liquidity reserve is held in a separate stress liquidity 
reserve portfolio managed by Group Treasury to cover liquidity 
outflows should a stress event occur and to ensure solvency at all 
times. The Bank also holds an intraday liquidity reserve portfolio. 
As at the reporting date, the total value of this portfolio was 
€6.1bn.  
With 145.4% as at the reporting date, Commerzbank was well 
above the minimum 100% level required for the liquidity coverage 
ratio (LCR). At 136.2%, the average of the last 12 month-end 
values was also well above the minimum ratio. Commerzbank’s 
liquidity situation as at the end of the reporting period was 
therefore comfortable given its conservative and forward-looking 
funding strategy and complied with internal and external limits 
and applicable regulatory requirements.

Summary of 2023 business position 
 
The 2023 financial year was overshadowed by wars, political 
turbulence and economic uncertainty. Commerzbank had a very 
successful financial year despite this challenging environment.  
We have now completed what is probably the most 
comprehensive restructuring in the Bank’s history, including a 
gross reduction of almost 10,000 full-time positions and deep cuts 
in our branch network. This means we have achieved the core 
goals outlined in the “Strategy 2024” programme. At the same 
time, we established our new business model in the market over 
the past years.  
 
 
 
The progress resulting from our strategic measures is 
demonstrated in impressive fashion in the results for the 2023 
financial year.  
The income performance during the year under review was 
significantly better than planned and enabled us to adjust our 
expectations for earnings performance in 2023 as set out in the 
Annual Report 2022 to reflect the steadily successful business 
performance in the 2023 reporting year – despite the difficult 
underlying conditions and considerable charges at our Polish 
subsidiary mBank. Our income grew by nearly 11% in the 2023 
financial year. This exceptionally strong income momentum was 
driven by strong customer business, while the ECB’s interest rate 
increases obviously also gave us a boost. 
Against the backdrop of continuing difficult conditions, at the 
beginning of 2023 we had expected the risk result to contain 
charges of less than €–900m for the year as a whole – before 
possible use of the TLA. Over the course of 2023, we adjusted our 
expectations regarding provisions – most recently to €–700m. 
Despite the high level of economic uncertainty and the weak 
economy in Germany, the risk result in the reporting year was 
almost 30% lower than in the previous year at €–618m. This is 
further evidence of the resilience of our customer business and the 
high quality of our loan book. We regularly reviewed existing TLAs 
during the year. As a result, we had a TLA balance of €453m 
available as at 31 December 2023, compared with €482m as at 
31 December 2022, to cushion expected further crisis effects. 
Commerzbank maintained its strict cost discipline in 2023. 
Through active cost management, the Bank was able to partially 
offset the high inflationary pressure as well as expenses for the 
inflation adjustment premium and a higher provision for variable 
remuneration due to its good business result. At €6.4bn, operating 
expenses including compulsory contributions in 2023 were higher 
than the €6.3bn forecast in the Annual Report 2022, but exactly in 
line with the new target that we had communicated for the first 
half of 2023. 
Overall, despite exceptional charges at our Polish subsidiary 
mBank, we generated an operating profit of €3.4bn, significantly 
above the forecasts made at the beginning of 2023, due to the 
sharp increase in income and due to our highly disciplined cost 
management. With a consolidated profit of €2.2bn reported for the 
2023 reporting year, an increase of 55.0%, we have more than 
exceeded our expectations of achieving a consolidated profit 
attributable to Commerzbank shareholders and investors in 
additional equity components for 2023 as a whole that is 
significantly higher than in 2022.  
In the Private and Small-Business Customers segment, the 
focus in the 2023 financial year was on implementing the central 
initiatives under the “Strategy 2024” programme – in particular 
the expansion of the online and mobile banking channels, the 
digitalisation of processes and procedures, and the development of 
the “advisory centre” distribution channel. Accessibility has been 
significantly improved. Skilled advisors are available to customers 
by telephone, e-mail or video, including in the evenings and at 
weekends, via the advisory centre to discuss all financial matters 
such as accounts, cards, securities investments and real estate 
financing. On the income side, supported by the turnaround in 
interest rates we were again able to achieve tangible growth in the 
Private and Small-Business Customers segment in the past 
financial year. This was reflected in a significant increase in net 
interest income. As expected, net commission income failed to 
match the previous year’s level. In Germany, transaction-related 
securities business in particular declined in the period under 
review because of the turnaround in interest rates and lower 
market volatility compared with the previous year. Overall, the 
Private and Small-Business Customers segment slightly increased 
its operating income compared with the previous year, in line with 
our expectations. In addition, mBank was able to more than offset 
the high charges from the provisions for foreign currency loans. 
Against the backdrop of the difficult macroeconomic environment, 
the risk result increased significantly compared with the previous 
year. This was also in line with our expectations.  
 
 
The key objectives of the "Strategy 2024“
have been achieved prematurely and partially exceeded
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
200 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Contrary to our expectations, costs in Germany rose slightly 
and this, together with an increase in costs at mBank, led to an 
overall rise in operating expenses for the segment. We were able 
to keep costs at the prior-year level due to a significant decline in 
compulsory contributions, and this, in conjunction with the higher 
operating income recorded, led to an improvement in the cost 
income ratio. Overall, the segment’s operating profit increased as 
expected, while the operating return on equity also showed a  
year-on-year improvement, as anticipated. 
The Corporate Clients segment focused on implementing 
strategy measures in the 2023 reporting year. Investments in the 
corporate customer business focused on establishing the business 
model with differentiated and efficient relationship management, 
further developing the technical infrastructure and other 
digitalisation projects. They also focused on implementing 
regulatory requirements in the areas of payment transactions and 
capital markets. All of the operational customer areas performed 
well during the 2023 financial year. The Mittelstand division 
recorded significantly positive income growth compared with the 
prior-year period. While income from lending business decreased, 
the Cash Management and Financial Markets divisions benefited 
from a marked rise in deposit income. The International 
Corporates division recorded in particular higher income from 
deposit business and lower income from foreign currency 
business. The Institutionals division posted significant income 
growth from both deposit and bond issue business. On the other 
hand, the income reported in the Others division, which was 
primarily attributable to hedging and remeasurement effects, 
contracted significantly. Overall, the segment recorded a pleasing 
increase in income compared with the previous year, which we 
could not necessarily have expected in our forecast at the 
beginning of the year. As expected, the risk result was significantly 
below the prior-year figure. As expected, operating expenses fell 
year on year thanks to successful cost management. On balance, 
the increase in income in particular led to a doubling of the 
operating profit. Accordingly, the cost income ratio improved 
markedly, as expected. Contrary to our expectations, the operating 
return on equity increased significantly compared with the 
previous year. 
Overall, Commerzbank can look back on a very successful 2023 
financial year. Despite the difficult economic environment and the 
high exceptional charges in Poland, we increased the consolidated 
profit that is attributable to Commerzbank shareholders and 
investors in additional equity components significantly more than 
expected. This was based on strong customer business and, with 
the tailwind of higher interest rates, income momentum 
accelerated over the course of the year. The Bank was also able to 
reduce 
its 
operating 
expenses, 
including 
compulsory 
contributions, due to its strict cost discipline. The loan portfolio 
also proved to be robust in view of the economic uncertainties and 
the geopolitical crises. With a net return on tangible equity ratio 
(net RoTE) of 7.7%, we have already reached the target set for 
2024 a year earlier than planned. With a cost income ratio (the key 
control variable with regard to costs and the earnings 
performance) of 61.4%, we have reached the level of around 61% 
that we expected for 2023. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1 
ratio) increased to a very comfortable 14.7% as at 31 December 
2023, compared with 14.1% at the end of the previous year. This 
figure already takes into account the amount set aside for the 
planned distribution. 
Overall, we can state that Commerzbank is doing well in its 
new setup. It is in very good shape, has returned to sustainable 
profitability in its operating business, and has a very solid capital 
base. We set out the framework for Commerzbank’s further 
development in the “Strategy 2027” programme presented last 
autumn. Growth – Excellence – Responsibility: these are our 
strategic pillars for the years ahead.

Despite the challenging conditions, the Private and Small-Business 
Customers segment slightly improved its profitability in the 2023 
financial year compared with the previous year and kept its cost 
efficiency almost stable. Despite significant charges in connection 
with retail mortgage financing in foreign currencies at mBank as 
well as increased risk result expenses and higher total operating 
expenses, both the operating profit and the pre-tax profit 
increased slightly by 2.3% to €1,024m compared with the same 
period in 2022. 
Income before risk result increased by €108m to €5,374m in 
the period under review, driven largely by very strong net interest 
income. The 11.3% increase in net interest income to €4,385m 
was largely driven by mBank. The significantly higher average 
policy rate level in Poland had a particularly positive impact. 
Accordingly, deposit business was the key factor in mBank’s net 
interest income, which rose considerably by €479m.  
However, the development of the interest-bearing business in 
Germany was determined by offsetting effects. While the 
turnaround in interest rates resulted in additional income from 
deposits, the loss of one-off income due to unscheduled 
repayments of retail mortgage financing in the previous year led to 
lower net interest income. In addition, interest rate model 
adjustments as part of the maturity transformation of deposits in 
the Private and Small-Business Customers segment resulted in 
equalisation payments between the segment and Group Treasury 
when scheduling model tranches, and this had a negative impact 
on earnings in the Private and Small-Business Customers segment.  
Net commission income was 4.2% below the prior-year level at 
€2,150m. In Germany, transaction-related securities business in 
particular declined in the period under review because of the 
turnaround in interest rates and lower market volatility compared 
with the previous year, which was reflected in a drop in 
commission income. This could not be offset by higher income

from payment transactions. mBank also recorded a fall in net 
commission income compared with the prior-year period.  
Other income items totalled €–1,161m, compared with €–919m 
in the previous year. The significant drop in income was mainly 
attributable to significantly increased provisions for legal risk in 
connection with retail mortgage financing issued in foreign 
currencies at mBank and to a negative fair value result that had 
been caused by, among other things, the revaluation of an 
investment. This was only partially offset by the absence of the 
negative impact on earnings due to interest and repayment 
deferrals for private real estate financing at mBank that was 
reported in the previous year. 
The risk result for the Private and Small-Business Customers 
segment was €–472m in the 2023 reporting period, compared 
with €–392m in the prior-year period. The increase was largely 
due to model and method adjustments as well as macroeconomic 
effects. As at 31 December 2023, the total of TLA stood at €175m, 
compared with €189m in the previous year. Further information 
on the TLA can be found on page 235 of the Group risk report.  
Operating expenses increased by a total of €162m in the period 
under review to €3,575m. In terms of personnel expenses, which 
increased compared with the same period of the previous year, 
higher accruals for performance-related variable remuneration in 
Germany as well as general salary adjustments were offset by the 
effects of the staff reductions implemented at the beginning of the 
year. 
At 
mBank, 
however, 
personnel 
expenses 
increased 
significantly compared with the previous year due to adjustments 
to salaries and wages. The segment’s operating expenses also 
increased – particularly due to inflation. 
Compared with the same period of the previous year, the 
expense for compulsory contributions decreased significantly by 
€157m to €303m, which resulted in particular from the absence of 
the levy on mBank required in the previous year to be added to the 
Polish deposit protection scheme as well as a lower European 
banking levy. 
Corporate Clients 
 
The Corporate Clients segment comprises four reporting areas. 
The three divisions Mittelstand, International Corporates and 
Institutionals are responsible for business with our core 
customers: the Mittelstand division covers Mittelstand (SME) 
customers and domestic large corporates with the relevant 
products they require. The International Corporates division looks 
after corporate clients headquartered abroad and large German 
multinational companies. The Institutionals division is responsible 
for managing relationships with banks in Germany and abroad, as 
well as those with central banks and selected non-bank financial 
institutions (NBFIs) such as insurance companies and pension 
funds. The Others division handles all business that either has a 
cross-segment risk management function or falls outside the 
strategic focus of the Corporate Clients segment. This mainly 
relates to assets transferred from the former run-off segments and 
effects from hedging positions. 
The segment offers customers the complete range of products 
of an international full-service bank, from traditional credit 
products and individually tailored financing solutions to cash 
management and trade finance, investment and hedging products 
and customised capital market solutions.

Business performance in the Corporate Clients segment continued 
to be very positive in the 2023 reporting year, despite persistently 
difficult general conditions. In particular, the still high inflation, 
uncertainties regarding stable supply chains as well as strongly 
fluctuating energy and commodity prices are causing uncertainty 
among companies. In this environment, we are assisting our 
corporate clients with all the challenges they face as well as with 
the opportunities that arise.  
Against the background of a noticeably lower risk result and 
significantly higher income compared with the previous year, the 
Corporate Clients segment achieved an operating profit or pre-tax 
profit of €2,142m, compared with €1,065m in the previous year. 
All of the segment’s operating customer areas contributed to the 
increase of €1,077m. 
The Mittelstand division recorded significantly positive income 
growth compared with the prior-year period. While income from 
lending business decreased, the Cash Management and Financial 
Markets areas benefited from a marked rise in deposit income. 
The International Corporates division recorded in particular higher 
income 
from 
deposit 
business 
and 
lower 
income 
from 
foreign currency business. The Institutionals division posted 
significant income growth from both deposit and bond issue 
business. The income reported in the Others division, which 
resulted in particular from hedging and remeasurement effects, 
contracted significantly. 
In the year under review, income before risk result was €689m 
higher than in the prior-year period at €4,481m. At €2,781m, net 
interest income was up €703m, i.e. significantly above the prior-
year level, while net commission income declined slightly 
compared with the prior-year period to €1,281m. The decrease in 
income from international and foreign currency business was 
largely offset by higher income from syndication business. 
Other income items totalled €419m, compared with €395m in 
the previous year. While net income from financial assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss increased 
slightly (by €28m) to €463m, other net income, which amounted 
to €–50m, included charges from the deconsolidation of 
Commerzbank Brasil S.A. 
The risk result in the period under review was €–155m, 
compared with €–446m in the prior-year period, which was 
affected by the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The risk 
result for the year under review resulted mainly from value 
adjustments due to defaults of individual counterparties and the 
increase in loss provisions for defaulted individual counterparties. 
At the same time, the segment has benefited from reversals of loan 
loss provisions as a consequence of disposals. As at 31 December 
2023, the total of TLA stood at €274m, compared with €284m in 
the previous year. Further information on the TLA can be found on 
page 236 of the Group risk report.  
Operating expenses were reduced slightly (by €51m) compared 
with the prior-year period to €2,111m. While personnel costs 
remained stable compared to the previous year, despite higher 
accruals for performance-related variable remuneration, operating 
expenses fell. The €47m decrease in reported compulsory 
contributions compared with the prior-year period to €73m was 
primarily due to the lower European banking levy. 
Others and Consolidation 
 
The Others and Consolidation segment contains the income and 
expenses which are not attributable to the two business segments. 
Others covers, for example, Group Treasury, equity holdings not 
allocated to the business segments and overarching matters such 
as expenditure on regulatory fees. Consolidation reconciles the 
figures shown in segment reporting with the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS). Others and Consolidation also covers the costs 
of staff, management and support functions, which are then 
charged to the segments. In addition, restructuring expenses for 
the Group are reported centrally in this segment. 
The Others and Consolidation segment reported an operating 
profit of €255m for 2023, compared with €34m in the previous 
year. 
The increase was in particular based on higher positive net 
income at Group Treasury. The development of fair value 
compensation payments for special redemptions of building 
finance by customers of the Private and Business Customers 
segment contributed significantly to this. Whereas the significant 
increase in interest rates in the previous year resulted in a 
compensation payment from Group Treasury to the segment, the 
segment made compensation payments to Group Treasury in 
2023. Profits from the interest rate risk management carried out 
by Group Treasury for the operating segments as well as positive 
effects from repayments of non-strategic municipal loans to the 
Bank also had a positive impact on the result. In addition, interest 
rate model adjustments as part of the maturity transformation of 
deposits in the Private and Small-Business Customers segment 
resulted in equalisation payments between Group Treasury and 
the segment when adjusting model tranches, which led to a 
significant increase in earnings for Group Treasury. This was offset 
by realisation losses from the sale of US government bonds, which 
Group Treasury accepted in order to reinvest the released funds in 
the US market at higher interest rates. On the other hand, the 
lower burden on Group Treasury from the European bank levy had 
a positive effect on earnings.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
In the rest of the Others and Consolidation segment, the 
absence of the negative impact on earnings from the residual 
portfolio of the dissolved Asset & Capital Recovery segment that 
had been recorded in the previous year (essentially in the risk 
result), as well as lower charges from net negative valuation 
effects, also contributed to the increase in net income.  
This was offset by the absence of income from targeted longer-
term refinancing operations with the ECB booked in the previous 
year and a higher net charge from the recognition and reversal of 
provisions. 
Others and Consolidation recorded a pre-tax profit of €236m 
for the 2023 financial year. This figure included restructuring 
expenses of €18m in connection with the implementation of the 
“Strategy 2024” programme.

Future economic situation 
 
The long-term consequences of years of expansionary monetary 
and financial policy will continue to shape the economy and 
capital markets in 2024. The interest rate rises that were 
implemented in quick succession are likely to be reversed sooner 
or later. After years of zero and negative interest rates, Western 
countries are now facing a completely different interest rate 
environment. Many business models will run into difficulties 
because the profitability threshold has risen permanently. 
Companies have to compete for capital and cope with higher 
interest charges once again. Adapting to the new interest rate 
environment will take much longer than if the interest rate 
increases had been spread out over a longer period of time. As a 
result, the economic weakness is likely to persist for an unusually 
long time. The Western economies are unlikely to recover rapidly. 
The Chinese economy is also likely to suffer in 2024 from 
delayed consequences, in particular from excesses in its inflated 
real estate sector – but not from higher policy rates. These delayed 
consequences are likely to have a negative impact – and dampen 
economic growth – for a long time. The loss of trust in the state’s 
economic policy due to its Covid policy and its crackdown on the 
tech sector in particular also suggests little growth. Added to this 
are the effects of the political tensions between China and the 
USA, which are limiting trade in technology products in particular. 
All in all, we only expect economic growth of 4.0% for the coming 
year. 
In the US, the dampening effect of the past massive rate hikes 
is likely to become visible. We expect a growth slowdown in the 
summer half of 2024. However, the US economy is likely to be 
spared a recession, so that it will grow as strongly as in 2023 on 
average in 2024. 
While the eurozone’s recession is likely to end in the spring, 
the upswing that usually follows a recession will probably be 
delayed. Although wage growth should soon exceed inflation, it 
will probably take longer for consumers to respond to their 
renewed purchasing power. This is because high inflation has 
caused consumers’ purchasing power to slump so badly 
(consumer prices having risen by 18% since the end of 2020) that 
they 
have 
significantly 
lowered 
their 
long-term 
income 
expectations. We expect the economy to largely stagnate during 
the whole of 2024.  
Germany is even more likely to undergo an unusually long 
period of economic weakness, as it will have to cope with other 
problems in addition to the new interest rate environment. Energy 
prices will remain much higher than before the energy crisis, and 
deglobalisation will require a change for many companies – 
especially those dependent on exporting.  
The overall picture for inflation has recently improved in the 
USA and Europe, and this will give the central banks leeway to 
lower interest rates. The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut key 
interest rates by a total of 75 basis points in 2024. The ECB, too, is 
likely to cut interest rates by a total of 75 basis points by the end of 
2024. However, high wage pressures in the eurozone are likely to 
keep inflation at 3% rather than 2% in the medium term.  
A market environment that is characterised by weak growth, 
falling inflation and cuts in policy rates generally suggests falling 
returns. However, the markets have already anticipated a lot of 
this, and this will limit the downside potential – especially in the 
eurozone. We expect the yields on ten-year government bonds to 
be 3.6% in the USA and 2.0% in Germany at the end of 2024.  
The euro should initially benefit from the likelihood that the 
ECB will cut interest rates less aggressively than the market is 
pricing in. However, it is likely to lose ground again in the second 
half of the year if the USA comes out of recession and achieves its 
long-term growth prospects – which are better than those of the 
eurozone.  
After its strong price gains in 2023, the DAX is initially likely to 
take a rest during the first half of the current year. The mild 
recessions that are expected first in the eurozone and later in the 
USA will make it hard for companies to meet analysts’ optimistic 
expectations for corporate profit growth. In the second half of the 
year, however, the policy rates in the eurozone and the USA are 
likely to fall, and this should boost the stock markets.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Future situation in the banking 
sector 
 
Our views regarding the expected development of the banking 
sector structurally and over the short and medium term are 
basically unchanged from the statements we published in the half-
year report for 2023 and the annual report for 2022. The banking 
sector will face new challenges in 2024, particularly from the 
slowing and diverging global economy. 
The ECB’s latest financial stability review (from November 
2023) also points to the risks resulting from the environment of 
rapidly rising interest rates and a weak economy in the eurozone. 
Business with corporate and small-business customers will come 
under particular pressure. However, these challenges will also 
present opportunities and competitive advantages for banks that 
are strategically well-positioned and flexible in responding to 
changing conditions.  
According to the Deutsche Bundesbank’s financial stability 
report from November 2023, the German financial system has so 
far weathered the sharp rise in interest rates over the past year 
and a half without any major problems. It currently has a high 
level of solvency in terms of the ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 
capital to risk-weighted assets. The current good earnings 
situation is enabling financial institutions to further strengthen 
their resilience to economic difficulties. They should therefore be 
adequately equipped to deal with crises. For the German banking 
sector, these mainly relate to a worsening of the energy crisis or 
the government budget crisis, which could have a negative impact 
on GDP. As a result of decarbonisation, the German corporate 
sector is already subject to pressure to adapt structurally, and this 
has been exacerbated by the uncertain geopolitical situation. 
 
 
 
Interest margins improved significantly last year, after 
persistently low interest rates had long been considered one of the 
key challenges. In response to the rapid pace of inflation, central 
banks around the world tightened their monetary policy. A marked 
increase in credit interest rates, including in Germany, is enabling 
banks to improve their interest margins significantly and is thus 
also boosting the income trend across the entire financial sector. It 
should be noted in this regard that the longer the current interest 
rate environment persists, the more likely it is that interest rates 
on bank deposits will gradually adjust, and that net interest 
income will consequently reduce. At the same time, demand for 
credit is being dampened by the braking effect of rising interest 
rates, limiting the banks’ ability to strengthen their earnings on 
the interest side.  
The central banks’ interest rate turnaround brought an end to 
years of price increases in the German residential real estate 
market. The sharp rise in interest rates has led to a significant 
decline in new mortgage business in Germany and many other 
countries in the eurozone. This is likely to lead to falling income 
from the lending business in the medium term, even though the 
margins on deposits have improved as a result of the general rise 
in interest rates. The longer term outlook for the residential real 
estate markets remains uncertain, because the factors influencing 
supply and demand are somewhat contradictory.  
Against the backdrop of the higher cost of debt and increases 
in the cost of living, it cannot be ruled out that the number of 
insolvencies may rise in the coming months. The net debt of many 
borrowers has risen sharply in recent years due to very favourable 
financing conditions in the past. A resulting need for value 
adjustments may affect both corporate and retail banking 
business. The debt sustainability of private households in 
Germany has so far proven to be robust, thanks to the persistently 
good labour market situation and – in some cases – strong 
nominal wage growth. However, a growing number of loan 
defaults in the area of consumer loans would be likely in the event 
of a downturn in the real economy and significantly increasing 
unemployment. Residential property loans, on the other hand, are 
far more significant. With these, long fixed-interest periods 
currently protect against rising interest rates. Mortgage loans from 
the low-interest phase are generally not due for refinancing until 
2028. The commercial real estate markets are far more vulnerable 
to the negative consequences of the general rise in interest rates. 
Both prices and transaction volumes have fallen noticeably there. 
The profits of commercial real estate companies have fallen 
significantly due to falling real estate prices and the resulting 
balance sheet valuation losses.  
As in the dominant interest-bearing business, the growth 
prospects in banks’ trading businesses are currently positive. 
However, many institutions have partially or even completely 
withdrawn from direct trading in the past. The banking sector can 
benefit at least indirectly because rising market volatility, together 
with increasing trading volumes, is leading to higher commission 
income in securities transactions. The number of private 
shareholders in Germany should also continue to increase over the 
next few years despite the improvement in investment alternatives 
in the bond segment. The planned pension reform, which will 
increase personal responsibility for retirement provision, is also 
likely to boost demand for financial products in the medium term. 
The growing number of shareholders and the increased use of 
digital and mobile products will increase the demand for 
individual financial advice among bank customers who are less 
comfortable with technology and are unsettled by the economic 
turbulence. Given the existing demand for advice on complex

banking transactions such as retail mortgage financing, branch 
business will remain part of the basic banking service, albeit in a 
significantly pared back form, and will offer universal banks 
competitive advantages over pure online banks and fintech 
companies. 
The Basel III reforms take priority in terms of regulation. At the 
end of 2023, the European Banking Authority (EBA) published its 
roadmap for implementing the final Basel III reforms in the EU. A 
final agreement on finalisation of the Basel III framework, which 
includes a standardised lower limit (output floor) for risk-weighted 
assets, is still pending. The international regulatory framework is 
to be further developed to ensure the stability of the global 
banking system. The focus is on risks arising from the growing 
importance of non-banks and on targeted adjustments to liquidity 
regulation. The banking turmoil in the USA has revealed 
deficiencies in the capital backing of interest rate risks, 
particularly at regional institutions. Interest rate risks could 
therefore be included in the minimum requirements in the future.  
Supervisors are currently paying attention to the internal 
models used in banks. To this end, the European Central Bank 
conducted a public consultation on its guide to internal models in 
2023. This describes, among other things, how banks can 
incorporate key climate and environmental risks into their models. 
All in all, it should be noted that a constant expansion of 
regulatory requirements may well have a counterproductive effect 
in view of the financing efforts that banks need to make in 
connection 
with 
the 
digital 
and 
above 
all 
sustainable 
transformation of the economy. 
To enhance the resilience of the German financial system, the 
German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority issued general 
rulings in 2022 to activate the countercyclical capital buffer of 
0.75% and introduce a sectoral systemic risk buffer of 2% for 
residential real estate financing. Both buffers had to be maintained 
from February 2023 and tied up a total of €23.9bn of Common 
Equity Tier 1 capital at the end of the first half of 2023. For the 
time being, the macroprudential buffers are to be retained in full 
in view of the continuing vulnerabilities – even if the economic 
outlook deteriorates to some extent. In addition, the German 
supervisory authority is calling for its legal spectrum to be 
expanded to include instruments in the area of residential real 
estate financing. Until recently, there was a lack of data on lending 
standards in private residential real estate financing that was 
sufficiently 
harmonised 
to 
meet 
the 
macroprudential 
requirements. The newly introduced data collection on real estate 
financing (WIFSta) provided this information for the first quarter 
of 2023 for the first time. Its current assessment of the risk 
situation does not suggest the use of borrower-based instruments 
at this time. 
In view of the limited earnings potential and ongoing 
competitive pressure, cost control remains the primary focus both 
for German banks and for their European competitors. As a result, 
the digitalisation of business processes in particular is likely to 
proceed at a rapid pace. At the same time, despite the pressure to 
innovate and reduce costs, many traditional banks are faced with 
the central challenge of ensuring the quality and stability of their 
IT systems, protecting themselves against frequent cyber attacks 
and maintaining the integrity of their data. The risks of operational 
disruptions caused by cyber attacks have increased massively in 
view of the geopolitical environment. Managing such operational 
risks plays an important role in an institution’s resilience. At the 
beginning of 2024, the ECB began testing the resilience of more 
than a hundred banks against cyber attacks through the use of a 
cyber resilience stress test.  
 
 
 
The next major innovative step in the evolution of the internet 
is the now rapidly advancing application of generative artificial 
intelligence (AI). AI has the potential to process huge amounts of 
data from a wide variety of sources at unprecedented speed, thus 
becoming the driver of the global economy. The EU Commission 
has published a draft law on artificial intelligence, the Artificial 
Intelligence Act (AIA), as part of its digital strategy. The draft 
contains concrete proposals for regulating the use of AI. Against 
the background of this technological transformation, the German 
banking market may be on the brink of an upheaval that will 
provide great opportunities to innovative market participants. 
In the long term, the banking sector will be shaped by the 
further development of the European monetary union into an 
integrated financial market union. The aim of the European 
Commission’s digital finance strategy is to establish a financial 
market that applies uniform EU-wide rules and thus ensures 
technology neutrality and sustainability as well as identical 
framework conditions for all providers. Many banking markets in 
Europe are still dominated by national legislation, with at times 
significant divergence in terms of regulations and customer 
requirements. There is also overcapacity almost everywhere, 
which reduces profitability. However, the European banking union 
that we are aiming for remains unfinished for the time being. In 
particular, the lack of an acceptable EU-wide deposit guarantee 
scheme (EDIS) prevents further market integration. The EDIS is 
the third core element in the European banking union, alongside 
the already introduced Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and 
the existing Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM).

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Another intended step towards greater harmonisation across 
Europe is the creation of a common payment system (EPI) that is 
set to become the new standard for payments by consumers and 
merchants. The EPI could provide European banks with greater 
lending volumes, as it would give them an entry into the business 
of payment card companies based outside the EU. The planned 
introduction of a digital euro should also create greater uniformity 
in Europe. With this, the ECB wants to make it possible for private 
individuals in the European Economic Area to maintain accounts 
not only with commercial banks, but also directly with them. 
Central bank money would then be available, in addition to cash, 
as a credit balance at the ECB. If implemented, care would have to 
be taken to ensure that the role of the banks as intermediaries 
between savers and borrowers was not put at risk.  
In addition to the way in which we will use money in the future, 
and the role of central bank money in this, banking regulation is 
focusing increasingly on the management of ESG (environmental, 
social and governance) risks. Therefore, the EBA intends to embed 
climate and environmental risks more firmly in banks’ risk 
management processes. In 2023, the EU launched a “Fit-for-55” 
climate stress test for banks as part of its strategy to finance the 
transition to a sustainable economy. This test is part of the EBA’s 
ESG roadmap, which aims to reduce net greenhouse gas 
emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. 
Climate risks will also be a focus in future ECB stress tests. The 
financing of climate-friendly projects will also be promoted, which 
will offer favourable business opportunities to appropriately 
positioned credit institutions. 
After a temporary period of weakness, Poland’s GDP is 
expected to pick up again despite the challenging environment. 
The upturn is being driven mainly by private consumption, but 
investment is also contributing to the recovery. Given the 
economic recovery and the strong labour market with its low 
unemployment rate and significant wage growth, NBP, Poland’s 
central bank, is unlikely to ease monetary policy in the coming 
months. As a result, policy rates are likely to remain broadly 
unchanged at 5.75% throughout 2024, supporting interest 
margins for the Polish banking sector. It remains to be seen, 
however, whether a decline in the quality of the loan portfolio will 
lead to higher risk costs and increased loan defaults. The biggest 
risk remains unresolved legal issues relating to foreign currency 
mortgage loans. The increasingly negative case law (from the 
banks’ perspective) has already led to high provisions being made. 
At the beginning of December 2023, Poland’s banks suffered 
another defeat before the European Court of Justice in the dispute 
over possibly unfair terms in foreign currency loans. This is 
expected to have a significant negative impact on financial 
institutions’ results in 2024, especially because no final legal 
solution to the problem is yet in sight. Increased tax burdens are 
also having a negative impact on the profitability of the Polish 
banking sector. Due to the state budget deficit, the situation is 
unlikely to ease in the near future. 
Overall, these challenging conditions continue to demand a 
high degree of flexibility and innovation from the banking sector. 
Financial outlook for the 
Commerzbank Group  
 
Planned funding measures 
The funding plan for 2024 envisages a volume of around €10bn. 
Commerzbank’s borrowing on the capital market is influenced by 
its business performance and planning as well as the development 
of its risk-weighted assets. Commerzbank has access to the capital 
market through a broad range of products. In addition to 
unsecured funding instruments (preferred and non-preferred 
senior bonds, Tier 2 subordinated debt and Additional Tier 1 
capital), when refinancing Commerzbank can also issue secured 
funding instruments, in particular mortgage Pfandbriefe and 
public-sector Pfandbriefe. As such, Pfandbriefe are a key element 
of Commerzbank’s funding mix. These give Commerzbank stable 
access to long-term funding with cost advantages compared with 
unsecured sources of funding. Issuance formats range from large-
volume benchmark bonds to private placements.

By regularly reviewing and adjusting the assumptions used for 
liquidity management and the long-term funding requirement, 
Commerzbank will continue to respond actively to changes in the 
market environment and business performance and secure a 
comfortable liquidity cushion and an appropriate funding 
structure. 
Planned investments 
For the 2024 financial year, we have again budgeted for €0.5bn in 
direct costs for IT investments. Just under a third of this 
investment will again be devoted in 2024 to restructuring the 
business model and digitalising the retail banking business. 
Another focus of investment, at around 30%, is further digitalising 
the processes in the corporate customer business. We will invest 
the 
remaining 
funds 
in 
IT infrastructure 
and 
operations. 
Regulatory measures are included in the above areas. 
Private and Small-Business Customers 
The investments in the Private and Small-Business Customers 
segment in 2024 will be related to the segment’s strategic goals. 
The focus will be on a user-friendly and cross-channel banking 
experience for our customers, complementing our two-brand 
strategy. We will systematically expand both our business with 
premium customers and our asset management activities. 
In the area of digital banking, we will focus our innovation on 
developing a virtual banking avatar that combines generative AI 
and avatar technology in one application. The banking avatar will 
be a virtual assistant (in the form of a digitalised person) that 
interacts with customers using natural language.  
Besides that, the focus of our investments in 2024 will be on 
the continual expansion of online services. We will also make the 
required know-your-customer processes available online as self-
service options and provide a basis for the accessibility of 
interfaces and documents. We will enhance our banking app to 
include additional service and transaction options. 
For our wealth management customers, we are working with a 
partner to expand our current product range to include a holistic 
advisory tool that will provide a complete overview of the 
customer’s entire asset base. Our acquisition of a majority stake in 
Aquila Capital Investmentgesellschaft mbH, a Hamburg-based 
asset manager, will accelerate the growth of our sustainable asset 
management business. Our investment focus in asset management 
is on creating a consolidated technical platform. In the retail 
mortgage financing and investment loan business, a large part of 
our investments will go into completing the new application and 
lending decision process stages.  
With regard to account products, one particular focus in 2024 
will be on further expanding the digital processes for concluding 
contracts with the various types of new customers. We are 
building on the progress we made in the previous year by 
developing further digital account opening processes. We are also 
planning to offer innovative digital payment products to small-
business customers in Germany through our announced joint 
venture with Global Payments Inc. Our focus in this area will be on 
flexible, cost-efficient and intuitive solutions – for example, 
enabling retailers to accept payments via their smartphones. 
In the 2024 financial year, further investments will also be 
made in an efficient and modern network of around 75 premium 
and advisory branches as well as selected wealth management 
locations. We will establish a cash centre to ensure the supply of 
foreign currency and precious metals to our customers. We are 
developing additional options for dispensing cash, for example 
through 
the 
use 
of 
third-party 
locations,

arrangements and the establishment of more self-service centres. 
The 
digitalisation 
of 
processes 
and 
the 
optimisation 
of 
organisational workflows and customer process stages are being 
driven forward in our advisory centre.  
The focus in the investment business in 2024 will be on 
expanding the content of asset management sustainability 
reporting to include additional regulatory content for customers 
that is mandatory. Another investment focus will be the technical 
implementation of the regulatory requirements of the German 
Withholding Tax Relief Modernisation Act (AbzStEntModG) and 
the technical preparation for the taxation of foreign exchange 
gains from 2025.  
Corporate Clients  
Investments in the Corporate Clients segment in 2024 will also 
continue to focus on the implementation of the strategic 
objectives. This will continue to take account of changes in 
customer expectations through digitalisation. The use of and 
demand for digital channels is increasing at all relevant customer 
interfaces. Furthermore, the integration of sustainability aspects 
will continue to be taken into account in the context of 
investments. 
The Corporate Clients segment continues to focus on German 
SMEs, large 
companies and institutional 
customers. 
The 
investments will focus on expanding digital self-service options 
and the product range to improve the customer experience for our 
corporate clients.  
In transaction banking, we will invest in the digitalisation of the 
product range and in our IT applications. With new, modernised 
systems, the further expansion of our online product range and 
innovative offerings, we will ensure our ability to deliver for our 
clients and secure our leading market position. 
In the capital markets area, we will improve access to products 
across all asset classes through additional electronic channels and 
platforms and will continue to digitalise our onboarding and 
advisory processes for OTC products. In addition, our platform 
consolidation with a view to reducing costs over the long term will 
be largely completed. 
In the lending business, we are also investing in the provision 
of an efficient loan processing platform as a prerequisite for the 
ongoing end-to-end digitalisation of the lending business 
(including automation of the public funding business). 
Further investment in Germany and abroad will be required in 
order to comply with regulatory requirements in the areas of 
payment transactions and the capital markets. This will ensure 
compliance with the regulatory requirements for sales and 
advisory processes, while continuing the expansion of our online 
offering through platform harmonisation.  
Further improvements in our IT system connections will enable 
us to work even more closely with our customers and partners. 
IT & Operations 
Commerzbank will continue the ongoing optimisation of its IT 
infrastructure in 2024. Significant investments will be made in the 
digitalisation of the workplace environment, in the data centre 
strategy and increasingly in cyber security. Commerzbank 
therefore remains on track with the digitalisation and streamlining 
of its business. The focus on modernising the IT architecture will 
continue, including with an update of the financial systems.  
Professionalisation of the technological base will continue, 
including with respect to testing/deployment, APIs (application 
programming interfaces) and the cloud. Technical innovations will 
in future be implemented for the entire Bank, which will 
contribute to the marketability of its future-oriented products and 
increase its IT productivity. The digitalisation of its product range 
will also be driven forward in 2024. 
In addition, increasing investments are planned in 2024 to 
implement 
various 
regulatory 
requirements, 
including 
the 
“Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting” 
(BCBS 239) and the ESG requirements. Investments will also be 
made to further optimise costs, increase automation and boost IT 
and operational stability. 
Anticipated liquidity trends 
The short-term repo market in high-quality securities (high-quality 
liquid assets or HQLA) such as government bonds, agency 
securities (issued by quasi-governmental US issuers) and 
Pfandbriefe continues to play an important role in servicing the 
bond markets and financing portfolios.  
The Bank’s liquidity position remains strong, meaning that it 
has no need to refinance its own portfolios. As such, 
Commerzbank is active in the repo market as a cash provider and 
also opportunistically as a collateral provider. The increased 
demand for refinancing in the repo market since the TLTRO 
maturity at the end of June 2023 continues. Commerzbank’s 
liquidity situation allows it to meet this increased demand and has 
led to an expansion of business in this area.  
Commerzbank has a high position in cash and demand  
deposits – mainly with central banks. This amounted to €93.1bn at 
the end of the reporting period. This portfolio is the result of the 
still high excess liquidity in the Eurosystem on the one hand and 
the broadly diversified customer base and existing business 
relationships in cash management and professional deposit 
business on the other.

Due to the only slow winding down of holdings under the Asset 
Purchase Programme (APP) as a result of the lack of re-
investments as well as the continued re-investments under the 
Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, we expect a still 
sufficient level of surplus liquidity and thus a supporting effect 
with respect to Commerzbank’s liquidity situation. 
Managing opportunities at 
Commerzbank 
 
The demands placed on modern, sustainable banking business 
and the overall framework conditions have changed markedly in 
the past few years. Whereas personal customer relationship 
management was formerly a key element, these days customers 
expect multi-channel advisory services, digital financial offerings 
and individual, tailor-made products that are available at any time. 
We have responded to this by continuously adapting our strategic 
direction over the past few years and will continue to do so with 
our “Strategy 2027” programme. In doing so, we want to become 
more efficient and create sustainable prospects for our workforce, 
customers and shareholders. Further information on our “Strategy 
2027” programme can be found in “Objectives and strategy” on 
page 185 f. 
We will continue to automate our business processes 
consistently and across the board. Within the lending process for 
private customers, this includes, for example, standardised 
products such as instalment loans or increases in credit card 
limits. With our Bank-wide “Simply simpler” programme, we aim 
to sustainably reduce complexity in all areas of banking. For this, 
we employ a structured, methodical and consistent approach. 
Topics are identified and implemented both top-down and bottom-
up in close consultation with the divisions.  
We are taking advantage of the high growth potential in the 
German premium market to restructure our service model for  
high-net-worth private and small-business customers. In the 
future, both generalists and specialists covering a diverse range of 
customer requirements will be represented in premium branches 
at a number of locations. By working closely with each other and 
with colleagues in the Corporate Clients segment, they will help 
the Bank ensure seamless customer service in both the private and 
the business sphere. We also intend to further enhance our strong 
positioning in serving German SMEs. As the leading trade finance 
bank in Germany, we are ensuring our presence along the 
changing trade corridors and are working on continuously 
simplifying our trading platform. In the Corporate Clients segment, 
we are focusing our international business on clients that have a 
connection to Germany, Austria and/or Switzerland or belong to 
future-orientated industries. We have gradually introduced an 
innovative direct banking offering – Mittelstandsbank Direkt – for 
corporate clients that require standardised products and advisory 
services. 
Corporate 
customers 
with 
complex 
advisory 
requirements 
will 
continue 
to 
benefit 
from 
personalised 
relationship management. Advice is being combined with 
innovative services such as the digital bank for companies and 
forward-looking, sustainable products. Data-based solutions and 
sales analytics support sales and enable efficient relationship 
management. We were the first German universal bank to receive 
a crypto custody licence from BaFin, the German financial 
regulator. This licence will enable us to offer a wide range of 
services related to digital assets (currently Bitcoin and Ethereum). 
For the time being, this offering is only intended for existing 
institutional customers. 
We will make the Bank much more digital across all segments. 
This transformation affects our strategy, technology, skills and 
culture, while also taking into account the particular risk of cyber 
attacks. We protect our customers and business lines from the 
negative effects of cyber attacks. 
Digitalisation generally means becoming simpler, faster and 
less complex. This is not only what our customers expect but is 
also helping us to become more profitable. We are working hand 
in hand with the delivery organisation, Big Data & Advanced 
Analytics, the Private and Small-Business Customers segment and 
our own front office to develop innovative solutions and processes 
– both for our customers and internally for our sales and 
settlement units. Customer trust built up over years facilitates the 
use of smart data and is thus a competitive advantage in the digital 
age. When introducing new applications, the focus is on the 
customer perspective. For some time now, we have been 
supported in this by our subsidiaries CommerzVentures (a venture 
capital fund for participation in fintechs, insurtechs and climate 
fintechs) and neosfer. As a research and development unit for 
future technologies, neosfer enables innovations and early-stage 
investments by Commerzbank. This is done by investing in early-
stage start-ups (neosfer.invest), developing business models or 
ventures internally (neosfer.build), and building ecosystems 
around the sustainable and digital future of our society 
(neosfer.connect).  
The new digital business models, with their ever-shorter 
innovation cycles and the need for faster product delivery, require 
the use of forward-looking technologies such as the cloud and 
artificial intelligence. A cloud-first strategy with corresponding 
migration of the IT systems also offers the advantage of driving 
forward the modernisation of the existing core systems. The pace 
of software and hardware development has increased to such an 
extent that new systems must be designed from the outset as 
easily scalable and expandable components. Large language 
models (LLMs) are now being used in customer service to improve 
efficiency. Robotic process automation and intelligent process 
automation offer the possibility of relieving employees of repetitive 
routine tasks and counteracting the shortage of skilled workers, 
which will continue to worsen in the future. The pandemic has

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
already massively accelerated the trend towards digital banking 
services. The trends in customer behaviour that were pushed 
forward during the crisis – more online banking, new payment 
habits, and robo-advisors in customer contact – are set to 
continue. Bank customers expect tailor-made services and 
products that are fast, easy and available at any time. This is 
where we will create an enhanced customer experience. To that 
end, we need highly automated IT processes and comprehensive 
data analytics methods that permit rapid adjustments in response 
to changing market conditions. That is promoting the increasing 
de-branching of retail banking. 
Commerzbank is driving its cultural change to strengthen a 
performance culture geared to success. We want to strengthen 
entrepreneurial thinking, as befits the start-up mentality, including 
among our own employees, We have also introduced a new 
collaboration model to reduce complexity and create clear 
responsibilities. 
By applying modern forms of collaboration and agile methods, 
we develop innovative products. We will use the delivery 
organisation to modernise the IT architecture while maintaining 
operational stability, to expand capabilities and capacities, and to 
develop new professional functionalities for our customers. In this 
context, we will introduce a new delivery model for IT services and 
build a platform that will massively accelerate Bank-wide IT 
modernisation as well as technology-based corporate innovations.  
Our transformation is opening up growth opportunities in 
future markets including digital ecosystems, embedded finance, 
digital assets and sustainability. In this context, we are guided by 
the environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. Given the 
clear evidence of the impact of climate change, we are currently 
focusing more heavily on climate protection. At the heart of our 
sustainability strategy is our commitment to be net zero by 2050 at 
the latest.  
As we emerge from the tough restructuring of the past few 
years, supported by our new, sustainable and forward-looking 
business model, we have earned and created the opportunity to go 
back on the offensive. The updated strategy presented last autumn 
sets out how we intend to do this from now until 2027. Growth – 
Excellence – Responsibility: these are our strategic pillars for the 
years ahead. 
Anticipated performance of 
Commerzbank Group 
 
Commerzbank achieved key “Strategy 2024” targets during the 
2023 financial year and informed the capital market in November 
2023 about its new financial targets up to 2027. Following the end 
of the 2023 financial year, Commerzbank issued its forecast for the 
2024 financial year at its annual press conference in February this 
year. 
The focus here is on the outlook for interest rates. It was only 
towards the end of 2023 that the market began to expect 
significant rate cuts in 2024 and 2025. The Bank took this 
expectation into account in its forecast but is sticking to the plans 
it formulated in November 2023, aiming to achieve a cost income 
ratio of 60% for the 2024 financial year through an increase in its 
consolidated profit. This is based on the assumption that economic 
activity in Germany will continue to be sluggish, reflected in a mild 
recession with negative growth of –0.3%, while inflation is 
expected to be 3%. 
In line with its strategic pillars of growth, excellence and 
responsibility, the Bank intends to provide each customer with a 
tailored service that meets their individual needs. Its aim in doing 
so is to broaden its revenue base and become less dependent on 
net interest income. This is reflected in its priorities for 2024. On 
the revenue side, its focus is on net commission income, which is 
targeted to grow by 4%. Huge importance will be placed on strict 
performance 
management 
and 
close 
monitoring 
of 
the 
implementation of strategic initiatives. Particular attention will be 
paid to increasing customer and employee satisfaction in order to 
promote sustainable positive business development.  
 
 
 
A high priority for the Bank, in view of its continued increase in 
profitability, is to carry out its plan to return capital for the 2024 
financial year. The payout ratio for 2024 should be at least 70% as 
defined by the capital return policy, but not more than the 
consolidated profit after deducting AT1 coupons. In addition to a 
dividend, this return of capital to shareholders will be achieved 
through share buybacks, subject to approval by the ECB and the 
German Finance Agency.

Anticipated performance of individual 
earnings components 
Commerzbank’s forecast of its net interest income is based on 
forward interest rates, which indicate as at mid-February an 
average ECB deposit rate of 3.5% for 2024. With an average 
interest rate pass-through to deposit customers of 35% and a 
slight increase in deposit volumes, the Bank expects net interest 
income of €7.9bn in 2024, compared with just under €8.4bn in 
2023. This assumes a slight decline in net interest income at 
mBank in Poland and a broadly stable contribution from lending. 
Net commission income for the current year is expected to be 
4% higher than in the previous year. Strategic partnerships and 
investments in asset management, payment transactions and 
equity capital markets – in addition to an upturn in the securities 
business – are expected to contribute to this growth.  
Net income from financial assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value through profit or loss is generally subject to increased 
volatility, which can be influenced only to a limited extent. This is 
due 
in 
part 
to 
the 
fundamental 
uncertainty 
regarding 
developments on the global capital markets. Accounting rules are 
a factor too. Sometimes they may require similar items to be 
presented as fair value measurements in the fair value result in 
one time period, whereas the interest component dominates in 
another. Year-on-year shifts between the income items net interest 
income and fair value result – and vice versa – are therefore 
possible. A portion of this income component is therefore directly 
related to net interest income. With its risk-oriented and customer-
focused approach, Commerzbank, like mBank, seeks to achieve 
income that is as high and stable as possible. After a fair value 
result of €–359 million in the 2023 financial year, a negative 
contribution cannot be ruled out for the current year either. 
Experience has shown that the other income items, including 
realised profit or losses on financial instruments and other net 
income, are often affected to a large extent by one-off income and 
measurement effects that are usually impossible to predict. 
The provision for legal risks in connection with retail mortgage 
financing issued in foreign currencies at mBank is recognised 
under other net income and is significant. Following high 
provisions of €1,094m in the 2023 financial year, further charges 
are possible, so that a negative other net income cannot be ruled 
out for the 2024 financial year as well. 
Following a figure of €–618m last year, Commerzbank expects 
a charge from the risk result of less than €–800m for 2024. This 
expectation takes into account at least partial utilisation of the top-
level adjustment (TLA) of €453m as at the end of 2023. This TLA 
reflects expected secondary effects in the loan book due to factors 
including global supply chain bottlenecks and uncertainties due to 
inflation as well as the impact of the currently restrictive monetary 
policy. 
Operating expenses, including compulsory contributions, will 
be managed strictly in line with the cost income ratio for the 
current year. The target for the cost income ratio is 60%. This 
means that operating expenses reflect any deviations from 
budgeted income and, for example, determine whether funds for 
investment are released or withheld. The expenses for variable 
remuneration are also affected by deviations from budgeted 
income. 
Anticipated segment performance 
Private and Small-Business Customers (PSBC) 
In the Private and Small-Business Customers segment, the range 
of optimised and digital banking solutions is being expanded for 
the Bank’s almost 11 million private and small-business customers 
in Germany. With its holistic approach and its two brands, 
Commerzbank and comdirect, it will meet all customer needs – 
whether online or mobile, in its advisory centre or in person in 
around 400 branches. Commerzbank wants to offer every 
customer the right model for their everyday banking needs. To this 
end, it will, among other things, further develop its account and 
card offerings as well as its payment transaction solutions. As a 
premium provider, Commerzbank aims to be the first point of 
contact for discerning customers. It will consistently expand its 
offering with a focus on securities and the lending business. 
Commerzbank sees opportunities particularly in asset and wealth 
management. 
Net interest income in 2024 is expected to be slightly lower 
than in 2023. This is due to the higher average interest rate that is 
expected to be paid to customers on their deposits. 
In contrast, Commerzbank is expecting a significant increase in 
net commission income for the PSBC segment. An increase in 
income from the securities business and an expansion of activities 
in asset and wealth management are expected to contribute to 
this.  
mBank’s contribution, which is included in net interest income 
and net commission income in the PSBC segment, is expected to 
be slightly lower in terms of net interest income and significantly 
higher in terms of net commission income than in the previous 
year.  
Overall, we expect net income in the PSBC segment to be 
significantly higher than in the previous year, on the assumption 
that the high one-time charges at mBank in Poland resulting from 
provisions for legal risks in connection with retail mortgage 
financing issued in foreign currencies will not recur to a 
comparable extent in the current year. 
Operating 
expenses 
in 
the 
PSBC 
segment, 
including 
compulsory contributions, are subject to the management of the 
Group’s cost income ratio, which is expected to reach 60% in the 
2024 financial year. In line with the expected earnings 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
214 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
performance, 
operating 
expenses 
(including 
compulsory 
contributions) are expected to remain at approximately the same 
level as in 2023, with a slight reduction in Germany being offset by 
inflation-related additional expenses in mBank. 
With a slightly lower charge expected for the risk result in the 
PSBC segment than in the previous year, we expect operating 
profit to increase significantly year on year due to rising income. 
As such, the operating return on equity should increase 
significantly and the cost-income ratio in the PSBC segment 
should fall significantly. This forecast is based on the assumption 
that the high one-time charges at mBank resulting from provisions 
for legal risks in connection with retail mortgage financing issued 
in foreign currencies will not recur to a comparable extent in the 
current year. 
Corporate Clients (CC) 
As the leading German Mittelstandsbank, Commerzbank will 
continue to provide close support to its corporate clients in their 
ongoing transformations. The Bank will continue to drive forward 
its strategy to date in the corporate customer business through 
targeted investments in products and digital solutions up to 2027. 
Commerzbank will therefore strengthen its transaction banking by 
investing in new systems and technologies and thereby secure its 
leading position in payment transactions and in the facilitation of 
German foreign trade. In international business, the Bank supports 
clients that have a connection to Germany, Austria and/or 
Switzerland or belong to future-orientated industries. In its 
lending business, its focus is on growth in Germany and on 
financing green infrastructure projects worldwide. Commerzbank 
will rely on its centres of competence for renewable energies in 
Hamburg, Singapore and New York to achieve this. In the capital 
markets area, the Bank wants to expand its offering in the digital 
currency business and to open its central online trading platform 
to additional asset classes. Another focus will be on expanding the 
bonds business. 
Commerzbank expects net interest income in the Corporate 
Clients segment to be significantly lower than in the previous year. 
As in the PSBC segment, the main reason for the expected decline 
is the higher average interest rate that is expected to be paid 
during the year to customers on their deposits. 
Net commission income is expected to be slightly higher than 
in the previous year. The expected growth is mainly due to the 
strategic measures taken in Cash & Trade and Capital Markets.  
As the quality of forecasting for all other income items in the 
Corporate Clients segment is subject to a high degree of 
uncertainty and net interest income is expected to be lower than 
in the previous year, it cannot be ruled out that the segment’s total 
revenue will also be slightly lower. 
In the context of its management of the cost income ratio, 
Commerzbank expects slightly lower total costs in the Corporate 
Clients segment than in 2023, in line with expected income, as no 
significant compulsory contributions are expected for the 
segment.  
We are expecting significantly higher charges for the risk result 
in the Corporate Clients segment compared with the previous year. 
This is based on the assumption that the continued economic 
weakness in Germany will lead to a mild recession and will result 
in higher loan loss provisions. 
In summary, we expect a significantly lower operating profit for 
the Corporate Clients segment in 2024. Accordingly, the operating 
return on equity and the cost income ratio are not expected to fully 
match the exceptional results achieved in 2023. 
General statement on the outlook for the Group 
For the 2024 financial year, Commerzbank expects to significantly 
exceed both the operating profit of the previous year and the 
consolidated profit attributable to Commerzbank shareholders and 
investors in additional equity components. The main reasons for 
the expected increase are a planned 4% rise in net commission 
income and the reduction of high one-time charges at mBank – 
although this is subject to a high degree of forecasting uncertainty. 
Accordingly, Commerzbank is expecting a further slight increase 
in the net return on equity in 2024.  
Commerzbank’s target for its Common Equity Tier 1 capital 
ratio is based on the capital requirements resulting from the 
Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). This minimum 
requirement culminates in the MDA threshold, which was 10.34% 
at the beginning of 2024. This compares with a CET1 ratio of 
14.7% at the end of 2023. Commerzbank thus has a significant 
capital buffer above the regulatory minimum requirements. 
Commerzbank is still expecting a CET1 ratio of more than 14% for 
2024. This target already takes into account a planned distribution 
of at least 70% of net income after deduction of fully discretionary 
AT1 coupons for the 2024 financial year. 
 
There are numerous risk factors that could nonetheless affect 
the 2024 profit forecast to a considerable, though not reliably 
quantifiable extent, should events take an unfavourable turn. 
These still include high global economic risks. However, 
geopolitical risks, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, which could 
significantly accelerate existing inflationary trends through the 
massive increase in raw material prices, also have the potential to 
weaken the expected economic recovery and thus have an impact 
on our business performance.

Moreover, trade disputes between the economic blocs Europe, 
North America and Asia, triggered by political tensions, remain 
possible.  
Other risk factors include a further tightening of the 
competitive situation in Germany. Along with inflation-related cost 
increases, a fall in margins to levels that are unattractive from a 
risk-return perspective could also delay and/or limit the 
effectiveness of the expected positive effects of the measures to 
increase Commerzbank’s profitability over the coming years. For 
further information on other risks, see page 250 ff. of the Group 
risk report. 
In Poland, there is still no immediate prospect of a final 
supreme court ruling on the legal situation concerning lawsuits 
brought by private customers relating to foreign currency real 
estate loans, meaning that further charges cannot be ruled out.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
A high level of crisis-related economic uncertainty still prevails in connection with geopolitical tensions. The model-based parameters used 
to establish loan loss provisions do not yet fully reflect these effects. According to Commerzbank’s assessment, the secondary effects TLA 
booked in this regard continues to reflect adequately the anticipated effects. In the remaining risk figures, the expected uncertain 
development is currently primarily perceptible in the figures for Central and Eastern Europe, where the current situation is reflected in an 
increased expected loss and thus a higher risk density. 
 
Risk-bearing capacity ratio stood at 191% as at 31 December 
2023 
• The RBC ratio remains at a high level. 
• The rise in risk coverage potential compared with Decem-
ber 2022 is mainly attributable to the Bank’s earnings per-
formance and to a market-induced decline in hidden liabilities. 
 
 
The Group’s exposure at default increased 
• The Group’s exposure at default increased from €517bn to 
€536bn in 2023. 
• The risk density likewise rose over the same period, going up 
from 17 basis points to 21 basis points.  
 
 
Risk result for the Group amounted to €–618m in 2023 
• The change in the previous year was mainly attributable to the 
impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
• The 2023 result was driven predominantly by defaults by 
individual counterparties and increases in loss provisions, 
particularly in the Corporate Clients segment, which also 
benefited from reversals of loan loss provisions as a 
consequence of disposals.  
 
 
Market risk in the trading book increased slightly in 2023 
• The VaR rose slightly from €13m to €14m in 2023.  
• The asset classes that dominated at the end of 2023 were interest 
rate and credit spread risks. 
 
 
Operational risk increased year on year 
• Risk-weighted assets for operational risks came to €22.8bn at 
the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The main reason for the 
increase compared with the previous year were provisional 
revenues in 2023. 
• The total charge for OpRisk events rose from €951m to €1,176m 
compared with the previous year.

Commerzbank defines risk as the danger of possible losses or 
profits foregone due to internal or external factors. In risk 
management, we normally distinguish between quantifiable and 
non-quantifiable types of risk. Quantifiable risks are those to which 
a value can normally be attached in financial statements or in 
regulatory capital requirements, while non-quantifiable risks 
include compliance and reputational risk.  
Risk management organisation 
 
Commerzbank regards risk management as a task for the whole 
Bank. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is responsible for developing 
and implementing the Group’s risk policy guidelines for 
quantifiable risks, laid down by the Board of Managing Directors, 
as well as for measuring these risks. The CRO regularly reports to 
the Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board’s Risk 
Committee on the overall risk situation within the Group. 
The risk management organisation comprises Group Credit Risk 
Management, Group Risk Control, Group Cyber Risk & Information 
Security, Group Big Data & Advanced Analytics, and Group 
Validation.  
The CRO also has responsibility for Group Compliance. It is 
Group Compliance’s responsibility to establish appropriate 
governance, procedures and systems to allow the Bank to avoid 
unintentional endangerment as a consequence of compliance risks. 
Group Compliance is led by the Chief Compliance Officer. 
All divisions have a direct reporting line to the CRO. 
 
 
 
The Board of Managing Directors has exclusive responsibility for 
fundamental strategic decisions. The Board of Managing Directors 
has delegated operative risk management to committees. Under the 
relevant rules of procedure, these are: the Group Credit Committee, 
the Group Market Risk Committee, the Group OpRisk Committee, 
the Group Cyber Risk & Information Security Committee and the 
Group Strategic Risk Committee, which decides on risk issues of an 
overarching nature. The CRO chairs all these committees and has 
the right of veto. The CRO is also a member of the Group Asset 
Liability Committee. Here the CRO also has a right of veto on certain 
topics (e.g. liquidity risk issues). 
The tasks and competencies of the respective committees are 
described below: 
The Supervisory Board’s Risk Committee is the Bank’s highest 
risk committee. It comprises at least five Supervisory Board 
members. The Risk Committee’s tasks include monitoring the risk 
management system and dealing with risks such as market, credit 
and operational risk, reputational risk and cyber risks (including 
information security at the Bank). The Risk Committee determines 
the type, scope, format and frequency of the information that must 
be presented to the Board of Managing Directors about strategy and 
risk. 
The Group Credit Committee is the decision-making committee 
for 
operative 
credit 
risk 
management, 
comprising 
two 
representatives each from the back office and front office. The 
Group Credit Committee takes decisions in line with the 
competencies delegated to it by the Board of Managing Directors 
and is responsible for managing all credit risks. It acts on the basis 
of the prevailing Group credit risk strategy.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
The Group Market Risk Committee monitors market risk in the 
interests of the Bank as a whole and manages limit requirements in 
line with risk-bearing capacity. To do this, all material market risks 
from the trading and banking book are analysed to identify risks 
early and for active risk management purposes. The focus here is 
on optimising the risk/return profile. 
The Group OpRisk Committee (OpRiskCo) is responsible for 
managing operational risks within the Group and in this regard acts 
as the highest escalation and decision-making committee below the 
Board of Managing Directors. The OpRiskCo also addresses all 
important regulatory issues that arise in connection with the 
management of operational risks within the Group. In addition, it 
deals with standards on governance and assessing the functioning 
of the Internal Control System (ICS) within the Commerzbank Group. 
The Cyber Risk & Information Security Committee (CRISCo) 
monitors and manages cyber and information security risks in the 
overall interests of the Bank. In this respect, it acts as the highest 
decision-making and escalation committee below the Board of 
Managing Directors. The CRISCo addresses all regulatory aspects 
relevant to cyber and information security issues and has the aim of 
ensuring appropriate risk management in this regard in accordance 
with internationally recognised standards. 
The Group Strategic Risk Committee acts as the discussion and 
decision-making committee for all types of risk, and its main 
objective is to monitor and manage risks at portfolio level. This 
covers risk measurement, risk transparency and risk management.  
The Group Asset Liability Committee (Group ALCO) is the 
Commerzbank Group committee responsible for the Group-wide 
and integrated management of financial resources, namely capital, 
liquidity and balance sheet structure as well as net interest income, 
in accordance with the regulatory framework. The Group ALCO 
monitors in particular the Group’s risk-bearing capacity and as such 
plays an important part in the Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process (ICAAP). The Group ALCO resolves the 
recovery plan. Resolutions of the Group ALCO are presented to the 
Board of Managing Directors for confirmation. In case of violation 
of a recovery plan indicator, the Group ALCO plays a central role 
regarding the escalation, the estimation of the situation and the 
introduction of measures.  
Moreover, risk issues are dealt with in other committees 
listed below: 
The Group Risk Management Executive Committee acts as the 
discussion and decision-making committee within Group Risk 
Management and is responsible in particular for the organisation 
and strategic development of risk management as well as the 
creation and maintenance of a uniform risk culture. It also ensures 
that the Group risk strategy and the resolutions of the Board of 
Managing Directors are implemented in the risk function.  
Compliance topics are dealt with in the Global Compliance 
Board (GCB). The GCB has been established as a forum to share 
updates on major compliance topics and supervisory actions 
regarding compliance in the Bank. Furthermore, the GCB serves as 
an information platform for segments and functions about 
compliance culture, changes in compliance regulations, updates of 
compliance-related policies and their implications. 
 
Comprehensive, timely, transparent and methodologically sound 
risk measurement is the basic prerequisite for ensuring that the 
Commerzbank Group has sufficient liquidity and capital resources 
at all times. The processes we deploy make our business and risk 
strategy measurable, transparent and controllable. The methods 
and models we use to measure risk are in line with current, common 
banking industry standards and are subject to regular review by 
Risk Controlling, Internal Audit, our external auditors and the 
German and European supervisory authorities. In our assessment, 
the processes are well suited to safeguarding risk-bearing capacity 
and permanent solvency on a lasting basis. We consider our risk 
management methods and processes and our risk management 
system as a whole to be appropriate and effective. 
We likewise consider our ICS as a whole to be appropriate and 
effective. Details about the ICS at Commerzbank can be found in the 
section on operational risk. 
Risk strategy and risk management 
 
The overall risk strategy, in line with the business strategy, governs 
the strategic risk focus of the Commerzbank Group. It sets the risk 
appetite as the maximum risk that the Bank is prepared and able to 
accept while following its business objectives without exposing 
itself to existential threats over and above the risks inherent in the 
business. The guiding idea is to ensure that the Group holds 
sufficient liquidity and capital. That also includes ensuring that the 
“Moving forward” business strategy can be implemented through a 
risk profile that is commensurate with the leeway determined by 
regulatory and capital market factors. Based on these requirements, 
suitable limits are defined for the risk resources of capital and 
liquidity available to the Group. The overarching limits of the overall 
risk strategy are consistent with the indicator thresholds of the 
recovery plan. 
Key strategic measures have already been successfully imple-
mented under the “Strategy 2024” programme, thereby reducing 
the remaining implementation risk. However, there are still 
significant idiosyncratic business risks that arise from ongoing 
challenges to the business model. These are essentially associated 
with technological advances, customer expectations and regulation. 
The “strategy 2027” systematically focuses on the key stake-
holders – customers, employees and investors – and their expec-
tations in what continues to be a very volatile and challenging

environment. The growth path embarked upon will continue to be 
pursued while simultaneously boosting profitability and the Bank’s 
attractiveness as an employer. Commerzbank has defined the three 
pillars of its current strategy as excellence, responsibility and 
growth. With regard to risk costs, the aim is to cover them through 
operational business at all times. 
The core functions of banks as transformers of liquidity and risk 
give rise to inevitable threats that can in extreme cases endanger 
the continued existence of the institution. These depend on the 
bank’s particular business model and are accepted in the pursuit of 
business objectives. The basis for Commerzbank’s strategic 
alignment is its business strategy. In the event of a sustained change 
in the assessment of the inherent and existential threats to 
Commerzbank, the Board of Managing Directors may have to adjust 
the business model and thus the business and risk strategy in the 
medium and long term. A distinction can be made between the 
types of risk accepted on the basis of two fundamental threat 
scenarios. The occurrence of an inherent, existential threat 
jeopardises the continued existence of Commerzbank. In this case, 
rescuing Commerzbank would hardly be feasible without state 
measures or significant regulatory support measures (e.g. 
protective guarantees, tolerance of significant deviations from 
regulatory capital requirements, rescue merger) or activation of the 
Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM).  
However, mitigation strategies are developed to counter these 
inherent existential threats in order, as far as possible, to reduce the 
probability of damage or the extent thereof. On the other hand, if a 
threat materialises that is inherent in the business model but not 
existential, there is always the possibility of mitigation through, 
among other things, capital measures available on the market or the 
use of appropriate capital buffers. It is therefore not necessary to 
activate the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) in this threat 
scenario. For Commerzbank, the existential threats inherent in its 
business model include, for example, the default of Germany, the 
disintegration of the eurozone and a default of one or more of the 
other major European countries or a default of the United States, a 
collapse of the financial markets in connection with loss of the basic 
functionalities of the ECB, or a bank run that entails threats going 
beyond the components transferable to Commerzbank as a result of 
currently known events, a collapse or a massive malfunction in global 
clearing houses, as well as extreme cyber attacks on states and 
institutions due to increasing digitalisation and geopolitical tensions. 
When pursuing its business targets, the Bank accepts threats 
inherent in its business model (non-existential threats). These 
include the default of one or a small number of large (peripheral) 
eurozone countries without significant systemic consequences and 
a deep recession lasting several years with severe effects on the 
German economy and the resulting consequences such as huge 
loan defaults, excessive drawing of lines of credit by customers or 
a significant outflow of customer deposits with effects on the 
liquidity situation. If geopolitical crises ensue, such as that currently 
resulting from Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine, or trade wars, 
for example between the USA and China, this may have a huge 
impact on global markets and threaten Commerzbank’s business 
model as an international institution. The measures taken by 
Commerzbank with a view to managing market, liquidity, credit and 
operational risk in response to the specific requirements of the 
geopolitical crisis – i.e. the measures taken to adjust to the new 
scenario following the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian army – 
remain in place. However, the observed effects on value chains and 
commodity prices also show that the impact is still ongoing and 
remains difficult to assess given the additional uncertainty 
surrounding further developments in the Middle East. In general, 
the geopolitical risk profile needs to be taken into account when 
defining the risk appetite in the sense of a forward-looking 
determination of the (country) risk disposition for possible 
geopolitical crises (e.g. with regard to China). As the digitalisation 
of the business environment continues to increase and Commerz-
bank undertakes its own digital transformation, cyber risk is an 
inherent threat that must be accepted. Depending on the severity 
and impact of a cyber attack, cyber risk can also be considered an 
existential threat, which is why Commerzbank is continuously 
working to improve its cyber resilience. The further evolution and 
possible consequences of mBank’s situation in connection with 
loans indexed in Swiss francs and with the additional credit holidays 
granted by the national regulator in combination with a default by 
Poland pose political risks. These may significantly threaten 
Commerzbank and could require special mitigating capital market 
measures.  
Environmental risk represents another inherent threat. By this 
we mean both climate-related and biodiversity risk, each of which 
can be further subdivided into physical and transition risk. We do 
not regard environmental risk as a separate type of risk, but as a 
“horizontal” risk that might materialise in the form of the familiar 
types of risk such as credit risk or market risk. The transition aspects 
in particular harbour risks (as well as opportunities) in the short 
term that are difficult to assess. Identifying and mitigating this 
threat to Commerzbank is one of the objectives of risk strategy. 
Accordingly, Commerzbank undertakes an annual process to 
determine for each type of risk whether environmental risks are a 
key driver. 
The need to record and manage the environmental risks was 
already established as a fundamental part of the assessment of risk-
bearing capacity. Furthermore, the carbon emissions intensities of 
the customer portfolio continued to 
be reported 
within 
Commerzbank’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
framework on the basis of explicit and externally communicated 
sector targets (SBTi), and an initial control system has been set up. 
On this basis, the management of climate-related risk in connection 
with the sustainability strategy being pursued will be further 
expanded and operationalised, including the ongoing improvement 
of data and methods.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
222 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
To the extent that it is able to do so, Commerzbank makes early 
preparations in anticipation of forthcoming changes in regulatory 
requirements and accounting standards. Such changes and their 
(retrospective) interpretation may have lasting implications for – 
and even threaten the survival of – Commerzbank’s business model. 
Commerzbank accepts these regulatory risks because there are 
many cases where there is no option to mitigate or manage them. 
The overall risk strategy covers all material risks to which 
Commerzbank is currently exposed as listed in the risk inventory. It 
is updated annually or on an ad hoc basis as required and set out in 
further detail in the form of sub-risk strategies for the risk types 
which are material. These are then specified and made operational 
through policies, regulations and instructions/guidelines. By means 
of the upstream risk inventory process, Commerzbank aims to 
ensure that all risk types of relevance to the Group are identified 
and their materiality assessed. The assessment of the materiality of 
a risk is based on whether its occurrence could have a major direct 
or indirect impact on the Bank’s risk-bearing capacity. 
As part of the planning process, the Board of Managing Directors 
decides how much of the risk coverage potential of the Group 
should be utilised. On that basis, individual types of quantifiable risk 
contributing to the capital requirements are limited in a second 
stage. A capital framework is allocated to the management-relevant 
units through the planning process. Compliance with limits and 
guidelines is monitored during the year, and management measures 
are put in place where required. In addition, further early warning 
thresholds are established in the overall risk strategy. Potential 
negative developments can be identified at an early stage with the 
help of these indicators. 
One of the primary tasks of risk management is the avoidance of 
risk concentrations. These can arise from the synchronous 
movement of risk positions both within a single risk type (intra-risk 
concentrations) and across different risk types (inter-risk con-
centrations). The latter result from common risk drivers or from 
interactions between different risk drivers of different risk types. 
By establishing risk management and controlling processes, 
Commerzbank provides for the identification, assessment, manage-
ment, monitoring and communication of material risks and related 
risk concentrations. This ensures that all Commerzbank-specific 
risk concentrations are taken into account in its risk management. 
Scenario analyses are regularly used to ensure transparency 
regarding risk concentrations. The structure of the scenarios and 
the integrated approach ensure that the impact of adverse scenarios 
on portfolio priorities and risk concentrations is examined in a 
targeted manner. Management is regularly informed about the 
results of the analyses so that the potential risk of losses can be 
avoided in good time. 
The Group Risk & Capital Monitor is the monthly risk report, 
designed for management purposes, on capital, credit risk, market 
risk, liquidity risk, environmental risk and OpRisk topics within 
Commerzbank risk management. It shows all the above risk types, 
including economic and regulatory risk-bearing capacity, for the 
Commerzbank Group. The report’s aims include providing the 
Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board’s Risk 
Committee with transparent and comprehensive information, 
highlighting important developments from a risk perspective and 
setting management measures. The report is also used in particular 
to monitor limits and guidelines within the overall risk strategy. 
Responsibility for approving the overall risk strategy and the Group 
Risk & Capital Monitor lies with the Board of Managing Directors. 
Commerzbank has adopted a code of conduct that defines 
binding minimum standards for Commerzbank’s corporate 
responsibility, its dealings with customers, business partners and 
colleagues, and its day-to-day business. It goes without saying that 
the Bank complies with relevant laws, regulatory requirements, 
industry standards and internal rules, and this therefore forms a 
particularly important part of its risk culture. It actively requires 
employees to behave appropriately, courageously, with integrity 
and in compliance with rules, and any failure to comply with rules 
is penalised. Expanded procedures ensure that misconduct is 
evaluated in a uniform and fair manner, strengthening consequence 
management on a long-term basis.

The main pillar of the Bank’s overall risk management and 
culture is the concept of three lines of defence (3 LoD), which is a 
core element of the Corporate Charter. Under the three lines of 
defence principle, protecting against undesirable risks is an activity 
that is not restricted to the risk function. Each unit (segment or 
function) forms the first line of defence within its area of operational 
responsibility and is directly responsible for identifying and 
managing risks within it while complying with the prescribed risk 
standards and policies. For example, the front office forms the first 
line of defence in all business decisions and has to take risk aspects 
into account in reaching them. The second line of defence for each 
type of risk lays down standards for appropriate management of 
risks of that type, monitors this and ensures the application of such 
standards, and analyses and evaluates the risks. The risk function 
forms the second line of defence against credit and market risks 
associated with business decisions. Particularly for credit risk, this 
includes involvement in the credit decision process by means of a 
second vote. Units outside the risk function (e.g. Group 
Communications) also operate as the second line of defence for 
certain risk types. The third line of defence is Internal Audit.  
Risk ratios 
 
Commerzbank uses a comprehensive system of ratios and 
procedures for measuring, managing and limiting various types of 
risk. The most important of these are listed below:  
Economically required capital is the amount, corresponding 
to a high confidence level (currently 99.90% at Commerzbank), 
that will cover unexpected losses arising from risk positions.  
The risk-bearing capacity ratio (RBC ratio) indicates the excess 
coverage of the economically required capital by the risk coverage 
potential. 
Exposure at default (EaD) is the expected exposure amount 
taking into account a potential (partial) drawing of open lines and 
contingent liabilities that will adversely affect risk-bearing capacity 
in the event of default. EaD is hereinafter also referred to as 
“exposure”. 
Expected loss (EL) measures the potential loss on a loan 
portfolio that can be expected within one year on the basis of 
historical loss data. 
Risk density is the ratio of expected loss to exposure at default 
and thus represents the relative risk content of an exposure or a 
portfolio.  
Value at risk (VaR) is a methodology for quantifying risk. It 
involves setting a holding period (such as one day) and a confidence 
level (such as 97.5%). The VaR value then denotes the relevant loss 
threshold that will not be exceeded within the holding period with 
a probability in line with the confidence level. 
Credit value at risk (CVaR) is the economic capital 
requirement for credit risk with a confidence level of 99.90%. 
The term results from the application of the value at risk concept to 
credit risk measurement. Credit VaR is an estimate of the amount 
by which losses from credit risks could potentially exceed the 
expected loss within a single year, i.e. unexpected loss. The idea 
behind this approach is that expected loss simply represents the 
long-term average of lending losses, but this may vary (positively or 
negatively) from actual credit losses for the current financial year.  
Risk-bearing capacity and stress 
testing 
 
Risk-bearing capacity analysis is a key part of overall bank 
management and Commerzbank’s ICAAP. The purpose is to ensure 
that sufficient capital is held at all times. The risk-bearing capacity 
concept is reviewed and optimised annually. The risk-bearing 
capacity encompasses a normative (regulatory) perspective and an 
economic perspective. For information about the key figures for the 
normative perspective, see Note 60 (Selected key regulatory figures) 
of the Group financial statements. 
When determining the economically required capital, allowance 
is made for potential unexpected fluctuations in value. Where such 
fluctuations exceed forecasts, they must be covered by the available 
economic capital to absorb unexpected losses (risk coverage 
potential). Only the economic value of equity components that 
absorb losses in the going concern approach is taken into account 
in determining the economic risk coverage potential. 
The capital requirement for the risks taken is quantified using 
the internal economic capital model. All risk types of the 
Commerzbank Group classified as significant and quantifiable 
within the annual risk inventory are taken into account when 
determining the economically required capital. The economic risk 
approach therefore also comprises risk types that are not included 
in the regulatory requirements for banks’ capital adequacy. The 
model also reflects diversification effects incorporating all types of 
risk. The confidence level for the calculation of economically 
required capital is 99.90% and is harmonised with the going 
concern approach. The quantifiable significant risks in the 
economic capital model are divided into default risk, market risk, 
operational risk and (not separately disclosed in the following table) 
business risk and property value change risk. Furthermore, reserve 
risk is included in the risk-bearing capacity calculation by means of 
a corresponding risk buffer. Business risk is the risk of a potential 
loss resulting from deviations in actual income and expense from 
the respective budgeted figures. Business risk is used to 
substantiate a higher-level management buffer that ensures the 
responsiveness of capital management. Physical asset risk is the 
risk of an unexpected fall in the value of owned property which is 
either already recognised as an asset in the Group’s balance sheet

or which can be recognised during the next 12 months under 
contractually assured obligations with option character (especially 
real estate). Environmental risks are defined as horizontal risks 
within Commerzbank that are manifested in existing risk categories, 
with both transition and physical risks being considered. The annual 
materiality assessment of environmental risks provides a 
comprehensive overview of the impact on existing material risk 
types identified in the risk inventory. Environmental risks are 
reflected in Commerzbank’s risk-bearing capacity analysis through 
a risk buffer for default and market risks, which are materially 
affected 
by 
environmental 
risks. 
Further 
information 
on 
environmental risks can be found in the section on environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) risks on page 258 ff. 
The results of the risk-bearing capacity analysis are shown using 
the risk-bearing capacity ratio (RBC ratio), indicating the excess of 
the risk coverage potential in relation to the economically required 
capital. Risk-bearing capacity is monitored and managed monthly 
at Group level. The RBC ratio was 191% as at 31 December 2023. 
The rise in risk coverage potential compared with December 2022 
is mainly attributable to the Bank’s earnings performance and to a 
market-induced decline in hidden liabilities. The decline in market 
risk reflects a reduced level of market volatility. The RBC ratio 
remains at a high level.

Commerzbank uses macroeconomic stress tests to review the risk-
bearing capacity in the event of assumed adverse changes in the 
economic environment. The underlying scenarios take into account 
the interdependence of the development of the real economy and 
the financial economy. They are updated quarterly and approved by 
the Group ALCO. The scenarios describe an extraordinary but 
plausible adverse development in the economy, focusing in 
particular on portfolio priorities (e.g. export-based sectors in 
Germany) and business strategies of relevance to Commerzbank. 
Current adverse developments (e.g. high energy costs) are also 
taken into account when creating the scenarios. Stress tests in the 
economic perspective cover a time horizon of 12 months. The 
scenario simulation is run quarterly at Group level using the input 
parameters of the economic capital requirements calculation for all 
material and quantifiable risk types. In addition to the capital 
required, the income statement is also subjected to a stress test 
based on the macroeconomic scenarios. Based on this, changes in 
the risk coverage potential are simulated. Whereas the RBC ratio is 
embedded into Commerzbank’s limit system, guidelines for risk-
bearing capacity are set as an early warning system in the stressed 
environment. The ongoing monitoring of the limits and guidelines 
is a key part of internal reporting. Defined escalations are triggered 
if the limits are breached. 
The risk-bearing capacity and stress testing concept is subject 
to an annual internal review and is refined on an ongoing basis. The 
development of the regulatory environment is also taken into 
account. In addition to the regular stress tests, reverse stress tests 
are implemented annually at Group level. Unlike regular stress 
testing, the result of the simulation – a sustained threat to the 
Bank – is determined in advance. The aim of the analysis process in 
the reverse stress test is to improve the transparency of Bank-
specific risk potential and interactions of risk by identifying and 
assessing extreme scenarios and events. On this basis, for instance, 
action fields in risk management including the regular stress tests 
can be identified and taken into account in the ongoing develop-
ment efforts. Commerzbank carries out various environmental risk-
related scenario analyses and stress tests every year. All material 
risk types are analysed in terms of the degree to which they are 
impacted by environmental risk, while risk types materially affected 
by environmental risk undergo a stress test. Commerzbank also 
takes part in supervisory stress tests – in particular it participated 
in the EBA’s “One-off Fit-for-55 climate risk scenario analysis” in 
2023 and 2024. 
Risk-weighted assets 
In 2023, the risk-weighted assets resulting from Commerzbank’s 
business activities increased from €169bn to €175bn.

Regulatory environment 
 
Commerzbank operates in markets subject to national and 
supranational regulation. In addition, it is subject to the overarching 
requirements imposed by accounting standards. Changes in 
regulatory 
requirements 
and 
accounting 
standards 
have 
significantly grown in frequency and materiality in recent years. 
They may have lasting implications for the financial industry in 
general and Commerzbank’s business model in particular. In 
addition to this persistently high regulatory intensity, the scope of 
regulations applying to banks is also expanding to include areas 
such as artificial intelligence, digitalisation and crypto regulation. 
Commerzbank continues to participate actively and at an early stage 
in the consultation processes aimed at preparing for the constant 
changes in the operating environment. It also monitors and 
evaluates current developments as regards future regulatory 
projects. At a global level, these include in particular the standards 
on market risk, operational risk and credit risk published by the 
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“finalisation of Basel III”). 
At European level, following the conclusion of the trilogue 
negotiations on the EU banking package, Commerzbank is 
monitoring the further implementation of the finalisation of Basel 
III, initiatives put in place by the European Commission to introduce 
a European deposit guarantee scheme, to create a capital markets 
union and to implement the European Green Deal, the EBA initiative 
to revise internal risk models and a number of projects in the area 
of digitalisation and crypto regulation.  
With Basel III, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
published among other things comprehensive rules on the 
components of equity and equity ratios as well as the management 
of liquidity risk. Since 1 January 2014, the associated Capital 
Requirements Regulation and Directive (CRR and CRD) have been 
in force as the European implementation of Basel III, with some of 
the rollout taking place in stages up to 2019 (“phase-in”). Numerous 
supplementary regulations have since been published, in particular 
by the European Banking Authority (EBA), and these are now 
progressively entering into force; this will continue in the years to 
come. At the beginning of December 2023, the draft laws for the EU 
banking package, consisting of CRR III and CRD VI, were published 
within the context of the finalisation of Basel III following the 
conclusion of the EU trilogue negotiations. Final publication in the 
Official Journal of the European Union is expected in the first half 
of 2024. In addition, the banking package envisages conferring 
roughly 140 mandates to the EBA for the detailed elaboration and 
review of EU requirements. The first-time application of CRR III is 
still planned for 1 January 2025. In contrast to the international 
Basel requirements, implementation in the EU takes into account 
the special features of the European financial market in various 
areas. For example, following lengthy discussion between standard 
setters, banks and industry associations, transitional rules have 
been included in areas of business that are of importance to 
European banks – for instance, residential property financing, the 
financing 
of 
companies 
without 
an 
external 
rating 
and 
securitisations – which alleviate the resulting sharp increase in 
capital requirements, at least temporarily, up to and including 2032. 
The current EU exemptions, such as those for loans to small and 
medium-sized enterprises, also remain in place. Commerzbank has 
analysed the effects expected on this basis and factored them into 
its internal capital planning by applying the necessary mitigation 
measures.  
The ECB, in its capacity as the supervisory authority for the 
eurozone banks directly supervised by it, conducted the annual 
Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). On 8 December 
2023, in its final SREP decision for 2023, the ECB informed 
Commerzbank of the results of the SREP and the associated 
supervisory requirements. The ECB increased the bank-specific 
capital requirements set for 2024 for the Commerzbank Group – 
“P2R” (Pillar 2 Requirement) and “P2G” (Pillar 2 Guidance) – by 25 
basis points each. With effect from 1 January 2024 the SREP 
decision replaces the previous SREP decision. In 2023, the ECB 
continued to closely monitor the establishment of environmental 
risk management following its Thematic Review in 2022. Several 
workshops were held in this context, the results of which had 
qualitative/quantitative SREP implications for individual banks. 
Commerzbank was not affected. The ECB expects full compliance 
with the requirements set out in its “Guide on climate-related and 
environmental risks” by the end of 2024. In addition, the EBA and 
the ECB have been conducting a “one-off Fit-for-55 climate risk 
scenario analysis” since the end of 2023, and the Bank will have 
completed its provision of the data required for this in March 2024. 
In accordance with the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD) adopted in 2023, Commerzbank will be obliged for 
the first time to publish a non-financial statement in accordance 
with CSRD requirements as part of the management report for the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
226 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
2024 financial year. This will replace the previous non-financial 
report produced in accordance with the EU Non-financial Reporting 
Directive (NFRD). Future reporting will cover a wide range of ESG 
issues in greater detail and span the entire scope of financial 
consolidation. In 2023, Commerzbank set up a Group-wide project 
to ensure timely implementation. 
The EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive has been in 
force since mid-2014. Responsibility for the drafting of resolution 
plans and the resolution of at-risk banks supervised by the ECB was 
transferred to the Single Resolution Board (SRB) in Brussels with 
effect from 1 January 2016. At the same time, eurozone banks 
started to fund the Single Resolution Fund. The SRB defines the 
formal Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible 
Liabilities (MREL) for the banks under its responsibility on a 
consolidated and individual basis.  
The legal basis for setting the Minimum Requirement for Own 
Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) and Total Loss-Absorbing 
Capacity (TLAC) was revised at European level and published on 
7 June 2019 as part of the Risk Reduction Package in the form of 
the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR II), the Bank 
Recovery and Resolution Directive II (BRRD II) and the CRR II. The 
BRRD II as a European directive requires implementation into 
national law within 18 months. The amendments included, among 
other things, adjustments to the calculation logic and, for certain 
banks, a statutory subordination requirement for parts of MREL. 
Most of the new provisions came into force in December 2020. 
The Group-wide recovery plan was updated in the fourth quarter 
of 2023 to reflect the regulatory requirements. The recovery plan 
describes in detail for instance the courses of action and recovery 
potential available to the Bank in the event of a crisis and which 
specific recovery measures, in various stress scenarios, will enable 
the Bank to complete its recovery.  
The regulatory environment also remains challenging with 
respect to compliance risks. Of continued relevance are the 
requirements in connection with the prevention of money 
laundering and terrorist financing – such as the implementation of 
BaFin’s new administrative practice, the planned creation of a new 
national anti-money laundering authority in Germany (Federal 
Office for Fighting Financial Crime) and the stipulations of 
international standard setters, for example the new EU anti-money 
laundering package.   
Given the geopolitical situation, the sanctions imposed by 
national governments or supranational institutions such as the 
United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU) are of particular 
importance for Commerzbank. In particular, Group Compliance is 
actively monitoring the sanctions that have been imposed in 
response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Most recently, the EU 
sanctions packages have been aimed in particular at preventing the 
evasion of sanctions via third countries. In addition, in 2023 the 
United States created the option of imposing secondary sanctions on 
foreign financial institutions, targeting transactions with certain 
sectors of the Russian economy. Group Compliance is also observing 
current developments in the Middle East conflict in Israel and Gaza.  
With respect to the plans to provide crypto asset custody 
services for corporate clients, for which the Bank obtained a crypto 
custody licence under Art. 32 of the German Banking Act (KWG) at 
the end of 2023, there are new requirements applying to 
Commerzbank. These include the EU’s revised Funds Transfer 
Regulation (FTR) and the EU’s Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation 
(MiCAR), for which detailed rules are being drawn up in delegated 
legal acts and publications from the European Banking Authority 
(EBA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). 
These legal acts will enter into force on 30 December 2024.  
In addition, the prevention of fraud, bribery and corruption 
(including Art. 25h of the German Banking Act (KWG), the United 
Kingdom Bribery Act and the United States Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act) and market compliance (including new EU 
requirements on sustainable finance, US requirements and CFTC 
regulations) are putting further risk types into the regulatory focus.  
Furthermore, the protection of human rights and of the 
environment at Commerzbank and in business relationships with 
suppliers along the supply chain is monitored by Group Compliance 
in accordance with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act 
(LkSG), which came into force in 2023.

Default risk is defined as the risk of losses sustained or profits 
foregone due to the default of a counterparty. It is a quantifiable 
material risk and includes the sub-risk types of credit default risk, 
issuer risk, counterparty credit risk, country and transfer risk, 
dilution risk and reserve risk. 
Strategy and organisation 
 
The credit risk strategy is the sub-risk strategy for default risks and 
is derived from the overall risk strategy. It is embedded in the ICAAP 
process of the Commerzbank Group and forms a link between the 
Bank’s overall risk management across all risk types and the 
operationalisation of default risk management. The overriding aim 
is to ensure the adequate quality of the credit portfolio. To this end, 
the credit risk strategy defines the credit risk tolerance, specifies 
risk strategy priorities, provides an overview of the material credit 
risk management concepts and thereby plays an integral part in 
maintaining the Group’s risk-bearing capacity. The credit risk 
strategy makes use of quantitative and qualitative management 
tools that are intended to give decision-makers clear guidance on 
both portfolio management and decisions in specific cases. 
The environment remained a challenging one in 2023, which 
was manifested in particular in signs of a recession, energy 
shortages and changing trade corridors. The resulting impact on 
Commerzbank’s loan portfolio was to be seen primarily in sectors 
that were particularly affected by this environment. In its credit risk 
management, Commerzbank continues to be guided by the 
principle of seeking a low-risk profile while limiting cluster risks and 
undertaking portfolio-specific risk management. A further focal 
point in this connection is financing the transformation of the 
German economy with a view to achieving the objectives of the 
Paris Agreement. Both the front office and the risk function are 
involved in credit risk management as the first and second lines of 
defence, based on a uniform Group-wide credit risk culture.  
Credit risk management is a joint task of the front office and the 
risk function, based on a standardised Group-wide credit risk 
culture. Impeccable moral and ethical conduct in compliance with 
the law and regulations is a key element of a culture of integrity and 
core to the credit risk culture. Default risks are assessed against 
uniform standards, regardless of segment limits. In line with the 
three lines of defence principle, the front office is the first line of 
defence and must take risk aspects into account when taking 
business decisions. The risk function (back office and Risk 
Controlling) is the second line of defence, its fundamental task 
being to manage, limit and monitor risks. The third line of defence 
is Internal Audit. It is tasked with independently auditing the Bank’s 
processes and safeguards, and as such also assesses the activities 
of the first and second lines of defence. 
The Group Credit Committee is the highest decision-making 
committee for operative credit risk management, comprising two 
representatives each from the back office and front office. It takes 
decisions in line with the competencies delegated to it by the Board 
of Managing Directors and is responsible for managing all credit 
risks. In so doing, the Group Credit Committee operates on the basis 
of the valid credit risk strategy. Reporting to the Group Credit 
Committee are sub-credit committees, which operate on the basis 
of their respective rules of procedure and within the competencies 
approved by the Board of Managing Directors. They comprise at 
least 
two 
representatives 
from 
the 
segments 
and 
two 
representatives from Group Risk Management. The sub-credit 
committees are responsible for managing all credit risks in the sub-
portfolios within their respective remit and are entitled, in turn, to 
sub-delegate certain credit decisions within their prescribed 
competencies.  
Discrete back-office areas are responsible for operational credit 
risk management at portfolio level and on a case-by-case basis. The 
responsibilities are separated between the performing loan area on 
the one hand and Intensive Care on the other. All credit decisions 
in the performing loan area are risk/return decisions. The front and 
back office take joint responsibility for risk and return from an 
exposure, with the front office having primary responsibility for the 
return, and the back office for the risk. Accordingly, neither office 
can be overruled in its primary responsibility in the credit decision 
process. Since the risk management function cannot be overruled 
in the credit decision-making process, the third-line-of-defence 
concept is adhered to. 
Higher-risk customers are handled by specialist Intensive Care 
areas. The customers are moved to these areas as soon as they meet 
defined criteria for assignment or mandatory transfer. The principal 
reasons for assignment to Intensive Care areas are criteria relating 
to number of days overdrawn, together with event-related criteria 
such as rating, third-party enforcement measures or credit fraud. 
The Intensive Care function decides on further action based on the 
circumstances of individual cases. Customers must be transferred 
to Intensive Care if they are in default (for example due to 
insolvency). This graduated approach ensures that higher-risk 
customers can continue to be managed promptly by specialists in a 
manner appropriate to the risks involved and in defined 
standardised processes.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Risk management 
 
Commerzbank manages default risk using a comprehensive risk 
management system. The management framework comprises an 
organisational structure, methods and models, quantitative and 
qualitative management tools and regulations and processes. The 
risk management system ensures that the entire portfolio and the 
sub-portfolios, right down to individual exposure level, are 
managed consistently and thoroughly on a top-down basis. 
The ratios and measures required for the operational process of 
risk management are based on the overarching Group objectives. 
The principle of seeking a low-risk profile in all business decisions 
is closely combined here with the risk function’s aim of providing 
support for business that is appropriate in terms of risk. Preference 
is given to transactions and products with a low level of complexity. 
Another focus is on the responsiveness of a credit line or exposure.  
Quantitative credit risk strategy guidelines limit risks with regard 
to poorer credit ratings and exposures with high loss-at-default 
contributions (concentration management) and for selected sub-
portfolios with a high risk weight or regulatory importance, and, as 
applicable, for individual products with a high portfolio share. 
Detailed arrangements for operationalising the guidelines for 
selected sub-portfolios are set out in separate portfolio policies. In 
addition, qualitative management guidelines in the form of credit 
policies define the target business of the Bank. At the level of 
individual transactions, they regulate the transaction type for which 
the available risk resources are to be used. These credit policies are 
firmly embedded in the credit process: transactions which do not 
meet the requirements are escalated through a fixed competence 
regulation. 
Group-wide guiding principles are based on risk-oriented analy-
ses of trends (e.g. of the development of weaker credit ratings over 
time) combined with an assessment of external framework 
conditions and internal rules. Risk-oriented analyses on key dates 
(e.g. rating profile of individual asset classes) are used in particular 
to derive portfolio guiding principles. Trend analyses of product-
specific risk drivers are key factors for determining product guiding 
principles (e.g. loan-to-value of mortgage lending). In contrast, 
credit and portfolio policies are primarily produced through a multi-
level coordination process involving the product and portfolio 
managers from the front and back offices, combined with an 
assessment of internal and external information sources. 
To monitor compliance with credit risk strategic rules, 
continuous monitoring and reporting has also been set up at whole 
Group level and at segment or sub-portfolio level. Asset quality 
reviews as part of the second line of defence make an important 
contribution to quality assurance. The focus of these reviews is on 
regular spot checks of selected dual-control lending processes. Ad 
hoc reporting processes have been established. In addition, crisis 
events may pose a risk to the Bank’s capital and liquidity adequacy 
and thereby to its risk-bearing capacity. In a crisis, the Risk 
Mitigation Task Force will manage decisions flexibly in a coordi-
nated, Group-wide process. For example, the Russia-Ukraine war 
prompted the establishment of the Task Force at the beginning of 
2022, and continued its work in 2023, in order to identify effects on 
the Group portfolio as quickly as possible and to be able to take 
countermeasures. As part of the process, emergency action plans 
ensure that risk-mitigation measures are implemented quickly and 
efficiently.  
The avoidance of risk concentrations is a core strategy of risk 
management. Risk concentrations are actively managed in order to 
identify at an early stage and contain the increased potential for loss 
from the synchronous movement of risk positions. In addition to 
exposure-related credit risk concentrations (bulk risks), default risk 
also includes country and sector concentrations. Segment-specific 
features are taken into account here. 
Management and the Supervisory Board’s Risk Committee are 
regularly informed about the results of the analyses. 
Management of economic capital commitment 
Economic capital commitment is managed in order to ensure that 
the Commerzbank Group holds sufficient capital. To this end, all 
relevant risk types in the overall risk strategy for economic risk 
capital are given limits on a Group-wide basis, with, in particular, a 
CVaR limit being specified. Due to the systematically restricted 
options for reducing default risk on a short-term basis, it is 
important to take account of expected trends (medium-term and 
long-term) in order to manage credit risk. For this reason, forecast 
values of credit risk parameters play a key role in ongoing 
management. At segment and business area level, changes to 
forecasts are monitored and adjustments made when necessary. 
There is no cascaded capital limit concept for credit risk below 
Group level.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Rating classification 
The Commerzbank rating method comprises 25 rating classes for 
customers not in default (1.0 to 5.8) and 5 default classes (6.1 to 
6.5). The Commerzbank master scale allocates precisely one rating 
class, stable over time, to each probability of default. The rating 
methods are validated annually and recalibrated where necessary 
so that they reflect the latest assessment based on all actual 
observed defaults.  
The probability of default ranges assigned to the ratings are the 
same for all portfolios. This ensures internal comparability consistent 
with the master scale method. For guidance and indicative purposes, 
the Commerzbank master scale also shows external ratings as well 
as credit quality steps in accordance with Art. 136 CRR. However, a 
direct reconciliation is not possible, because external ratings of 
different portfolios show fluctuating default rates from year to year.  
In lending decisions, which are based among other things on the 
rating result, the credit approval authorities of both individual staff 
and the committees (Board of Managing Directors, Credit Com-
mittee, sub-credit committees) are graduated by a range of factors 
including size of exposure and rating class.

Risk mitigation 
The collateral taken into account in risk management changed in 
the period under review from €126.4bn to €123.9bn based on the 
most realistic value (MRV) for positions in the Group’s performing 
portfolio, and remained unchanged at €1.4bn for positions in the 
default portfolio. 
Commerzbank mitigates credit risk through various measures 
including collateral and netting procedures.  
Types of collateral include in particular land charges, financial 
collateral, guarantees, indemnities, credit derivatives, life insurance 
policies, other registered liens and other physical collateral.  
The Bank takes account of credit risk mitigation effects from the 
acceptance of recognisable warranties (guarantees, comparable 
claims on third parties) by using the guarantor’s risk parameters 
(PD and LGD) and/or the regulatory risk weightings. 
As at the reporting date, no loan loss provisions were created for 
transactions in the performing portfolio with a total volume of €5.3bn 
(31 December 2022: €5.5bn), as these are entirely collateralised.  
Guarantors are subject to a creditworthiness check and rating 
assignment based on their sector and business as part of the 
assessment of their declaration of liability. The aim of the credit-
worthiness check is to establish the guarantor’s creditworthyness 
and maximum solvency. 
The quality of the collateralisation is rigorously checked and 
monitored on an ongoing basis. carried out at appropriate intervals 
depending on the type of collateral, at least annually or on an event-
driven basis. Positive correlations between the debtor’s credit-
worthiness and the value of the collateral or guarantee are defined 
in the credit and collateral processing process; collateral instru-
ments affected are not counted. Collateral is processed and evalua-
ted primarily outside the front office. 
The Bank analyses all credit collateral (physical and personal 
collateral) for evidence of collateral concentrations. The analysis 
includes checks on various dimensions such as collateral categories, 
the borrower’s rating classes or regional allocations of collateral. 
The Board of Managing Directors receives regular information in 
respect of the above dimensions about changes in the collateral pool 
and possible issues/concentrations.  
The measurement and processing of collateral is governed by 
generally applicable standards and collateral-specific instructions 
(guidelines, process descriptions, IT instructions). Collateral agree-
ments are legally reviewed; standard agreements and templates are 
used where possible. The standards established to hedge or mitigate 
credit risk include: 
 
• Legal and operational standards for documentation and data 
collection and measurement standards. 
• Standards to ensure the uniformity and timeliness of collateral 
measurement through the definition of measurement processes, 
uniform measurement methods, parameters and defined colla-
teral discounts, clear definition of competences and responsi-
bility for the processing and measurement process, and regular 
remeasurement frequencies. 
• Other standards to take account of specific risks such as 
operational risk, correlation and concentration risk, market price 
change risk (e.g. due to currency fluctuations), country risk, 
legal and legal change risk and the risk of inadequate insurance 
coverage. 
Commerzbank Group 
 
Commerzbank focuses its business on two customer segments, 
Private and Small-Business Customers and Corporate Clients.  
A high level of crisis-related economic uncertainty still prevails 
in connection with geopolitical tensions. The model-based 
parameters used to establish loan loss provisions do not yet fully 
reflect these effects. According to Commerzbank’s assessment, the 
secondary effects TLA booked in this regard continues to reflect 
adequately the anticipated effects.  
In the remaining risk figures, the expected uncertain develop-
ment is currently primarily perceptible in the figures for Central and 
Eastern Europe, where the current situation is reflected in an 
increased expected loss and thus a higher risk density. 
Credit risk parameters 
The credit risk parameters in the Commerzbank Group are dis-
tributed in the rating classes 1.0 to 5.8 over the segments as follows:

In establishing country risk, transfer risks are recognised that arise 
from the economic and political situation of a country and to which 
all economic entities in the country are subject. Country risks are 
managed on the basis of transfer risk limits defined at country level. 
Country exposures which are significant for Commerzbank due to 
their size are handled by the Credit Committee on a separate basis. 
The regional breakdown of the exposure corresponds to the 
Bank’s strategic direction and reflects the main areas of its global 
business activities.

More than half of the Bank’s exposure relates to Germany, just 
under one-third to other countries in Europe, 9% to North America 
and 3% to Asia. The rest is broadly diversified and is split among a 
large number of countries where we serve German exporters in 
particular or where Commerzbank has a local presence. The 
expected loss of the Group portfolio is mainly divided between 
Germany and the other European countries. 
Risk result 
The risk result relating to the Group’s lending business in 2023 
amounted to €–618m (prior-year period: €–876m). 
The following table shows the breakdown of the risk result by 
stage according to IFRS 9. Note 31 of the Group financial statements 
(Credit risks and credit losses) provides details on the stages. Note 
11 (Risk result) gives the definition of the risk result.

1 POCI – purchased or originated credit-impaired. 
 
The risk result decreased by €258m to €–618m year on year. The 
change in the previous year was mainly attributable to the impact of 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The 2023 result was driven 
predominantly by defaults by individual counterparties and increa-
ses in loan loss provisions, particularly in the Corporate Clients 
segment, which also benefited from reversals of loan loss provisions 
as a consequence of disposals. Meanwhile, the Private and Small-
Business Customers segment was impacted by modelling and 
methodological effects, including the reflection of macroeconomic 
trends. The main modelling and methodological effects were the 
charges from the anticipation of an expected adjustment of models 
(“future of IRB”) and the introduction of the “threefold PD” as an 
additional backstop indicator. 
The total secondary effects TLA at Group level as at 31 Decem-
ber 2023 was €453m (€482m in the previous year).  
A high level of crisis-related economic uncertainty still prevails 
in connection with geopolitical tensions. The model-based 
parameters used to establish loan loss provisions do not yet fully 
reflect these effects. The secondary effects TLA booked in this 
regard was reviewed during the year at the quarterly reporting 
dates and, in Commerzbank’s assessment, continues to reflect 
adequately the anticipated effects. The baseline scenario on which 
the TLA is based includes the following assumptions: 
• The global economy is suffering as a result of geopolitical 
tensions (e.g. the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Middle East 
conflict) and the widespread tightening of monetary policy.  
• Positive effects resulting from the gradual resolution of supply 
chain issues and from the easing in energy markets are not 
sufficient to make up for the negative effects of a restrictive 
monetary policy, which, with a time lag, is increasingly acting as 
a drag on economic activity. 
• The eurozone economy is suffering as a consequence of the high 
interest rate environment, which is having a sharply negative 
impact on capital expenditure, on consumer spending and 
specifically on sectors such as real estate.  
• The German economy will remain weak because, in addition to 
the high interest rate environment, it is also having to cope with 
a contraction in demand from abroad. 
 
The adequacy of the TLA is continually reviewed. (Details on the 
background to and adjustment of the TLA can also be found in Note 
31 of the Group financial statements (Credit risks and credit losses).)  
Further drivers of the risk result in the reporting period are 
addressed in the following explanatory notes on the segments.  
Default portfolio 
The Group’s default portfolio decreased by €901m in 2023 and 
stood at €4,756m as at the end of the year. In addition to defaults, 
recoveries and disposals relating to individual cases, the change is 
largely due to the reduction in the Russian portfolio.  
The following breakdown of the default portfolio shows the 
claims in the default portfolio in the amortised cost and fair value 
OCI (other comprehensive income) categories. The loans are almost 
exclusively assigned to the amortised cost category, of which by far 
the greatest share of €4.5bn (31 December 2022: €5.4bn) relates to 
the loans and receivables class and €218m (31 December 2022: 
€249m) to off-balance-sheet transactions. As at 31 December 2023, 
the volume of defaulted securities that can be assigned to the debt 
securities class was €27m in the fair value OCI category (31 Decem-
ber 2022: €0m). The collateral shown is liable to the full extent for 
loans in the amortised cost category, with €1.3bn (31 December 
2022: €1.4bn) relating to loans and receivables and €26m 
(31 December 2022: €16m) to off-balance-sheet transactions. 
As at 31 December 2023, there was €0m default volume to be 
reported for credit transactions in the fair value OCI category 
(31 December 2022: €57m).

Commerzbank uses the definition in Art. 178 CRR as the criterion 
for default. The EBA guidelines on the application of the definition 
of default referred to in Art. 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 
are taken into account. The default portfolio is divided into the 
following 5 classes based on the nature of the default: 
 
• Rating class 6.1: Over 90 days past due; 
• Rating class 6.2: Unlikely to pay; 
• Rating class 6.3: The Bank is assisting in financial rescue or 
distressed restructuring at the customer by making 
concessions; 
• Rating class 6.4: The Bank has demanded immediate 
repayment of its claims; 
• Rating class 6.5: The customer is in insolvency.

Overdrafts in the performing loan book 
In order to avoid an increase in the default portfolio, overdrafts are 
closely monitored at Commerzbank. In addition to the 90 days-past-
due trigger event, IT-based management of overdrafts starts on the 
first day the account is overdrawn. The table below shows 
overdrafts outside the default portfolio based on the exposure at 
default as at the end of December 2023. The changes may also be 
due to short-term overdrafts:

1 The structuring of the sub-segments was adjusted in the first quarter of 2023; the figures as at 31 December 2023 are therefore only to a limited extent comparable to those as at  
   31 December 2022. 
 
The risk result in the Private and Small-Business Customers segment 
was €–472m in the 2023 financial year (previous year: €–392m). The 
main drivers were modelling and methodological effects as well as 
macroeconomic effects, such as the introduction of the “threefold PD” 
as an additional backstop indicator, and charges from the 
anticipation of the expected adjustment to models (“future of IRB”) 
for the purpose of including forward-looking information as pre-
scribed by IFRS 9. 
The secondary effects TLA remains a necessity in view of crisis-
related economic uncertainty and remained in place for 2023. The 
total TLA was €175m as at 31 December 2023 (previous year: 
€189m).  
The risk result at mBank as at 31 December 2023 was €–241m 
(previous year: €–174m) and was mainly driven by the retail 
banking portfolio. The increase was due to difficulties identified 
among micro-enterprises and individual customers. This was 
amplified by the recalibration of the risk model and changes in 
staging. 
Despite 
the 
difficult 
economic 
and 
geopolitical 
environment, the risk result in Corporate and Investment Banking 
is at a similar level to the previous year. 
The default portfolio in the segment stood at €2,053m as at the 
reporting date (31 December 2022: €1,842m), which was above the 
figure for the previous year.

Corporate Clients segment 
The Corporate Clients segment (CC) comprises the Group’s 
activities with mid-size corporate clients, the public sector, 
institutional customers and multinational corporates. The segment 
is also responsible for the Group’s relationships with banks and 
financial institutions in Germany and abroad, as well as with central 
banks. The regional focus of our activities is on Germany and 
Western Europe. The Group’s customer-oriented capital markets 
activities are also bundled in this segment. 
The EaD of the Corporate Clients segment decreased from 
€177bn to €176bn compared with 31 December of the previous 
year. Risk density increased from 21 basis points to 23 basis points.

The risk result for the Corporate Clients segment in the 2023 
financial year was €–155m (previous year: €–446m). The change in 
the previous year was mainly attributable to the impact of the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine.  
Valuation allowances in the segment were mainly driven by 
defaults of individual counterparties and the increase in loss 
provisions for defaulted individual counterparties. At the same time, 
the segment has benefited from reversals of loan loss provisions as 
a consequence of disposals. The risk result also includes charges 
from modelling and methodological effects, such as the 
introduction of the “threefold PD” as an additional backstop 
indicator, and from the anticipation of the expected adjustment of 
models (“future of IRB”) and the reflection of macroeconomic 
trends.  
The total TLA as at 31 December 2023 was €274m (previous year: 
€284m). The secondary effects TLA remains a necessity in view of 
crisis-related economic uncertainty and remained in place for 2023.  
The default portfolio in the segment stood at €2,459m as at the 
end of 2023 (31 December 2022: €2,811m). The contraction in 2023 
was due in particular to the disposal of individual exposures from 
the default portfolio in the International Corporates portfolio.

Further portfolio analyses 
 
The analyses below are independent of the existing segment 
allocation. The positions shown are already contained in full in the 
Group and segment presentations above. 
 
Corporates portfolio by sector 
So far, a number of sectors have been benefiting from full order 
books and healthy earnings, although there are signs of a cross-
sector decline in incoming orders. The reduction in purchasing 
power resulting from the high level of interest rates as well as shifts 
in consumer behaviour are leading to falling gross income along 
with rising costs. As a consequence, shrinking profitability can be 
observed in a number of industries, but particularly in consumer-
oriented sectors.  
The current economic environment in Germany and the delicate 
geopolitical situation are having a negative impact on capital 
expenditure in some areas. A shortage of skilled labour, inflation, 
the higher cost of materials and labour, cumbersome bureaucracy 
and reduced demand for (consumer) goods are putting a strain on 
our customers. At the same time, falling supplies of LNG and lower 
temperatures in the coming winter could again present a severe test 
for energy supply across all sectors. 
Sizeable amounts of financing are still required for investment 
in environmental protection and CO2-neutral production. Reducing 
dependencies and ensuring a stable supply chain will also create a 
cost burden. However, we regard our clients as being broadly well 
positioned in these respects. 
A breakdown of the corporates exposure by sector is shown 
below:

Financial Institutions portfolio 
Our network of correspondent banks continued to focus on trade 
finance activities on behalf of our corporate customers and on 
capital market activities. In derivatives, we enter into trades with 
counterparties selected according to internal policies under the 
European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) standards.  
We continue to keep a close watch on the impact of regulatory 
requirements on banks. In this context, we continue to pursue our 
strategy of holding as few exposures as possible which might 
absorb losses in the event of a bail-in of an affected institution. 
We are keeping a close eye on developments in various countries 
affected by specific issues such as recessions, embargoes and 
economic uncertainty caused by political events (at present in 
particular the situation in the Middle East) and are responding with 
flexible portfolio management that is tailored to the individual 
situation of each country. This applies in particular to the impact on 
banks’ loan portfolios due to high inflation and rising interest rates 
in recent years, trends in energy prices and recurring supply 
bottlenecks. All this impacts our correspondent banks, both in 
industrialised countries and in developing countries.  
Overall, our risk appetite is geared to keeping the portfolio as 
responsive as possible.

1 The definition of financial institutions was adjusted in the first quarter of 2023 and central banks (€87bn as at 31 December 2022) were reclassified; the figures as at 31 December 
2023 are therefore not comparable to those as at 31 December 2022. 
 
Non-Bank Financial Institutions portfolio 
In Commerzbank’s assessment, the Non-Bank Financial Institutions 
(NBFI) portfolio mainly comprises insurance companies, asset 
managers, regulated funds and central counterparties. Business 
activities are focused on Germany, Western Europe, the United 
States and Asia. 
Commerzbank conducts new business with NBFIs partly in 
consideration of regulatory requirements (clearing via central 
counterparties) and partly in the interests of our institutional 
customers; from the Bank’s perspective the focus is on attractive 
opportunities with customers with good credit ratings and valuable 
security. 
We manage our portfolios with the aim of ensuring their high 
quality and responsiveness. We are keeping a close eye on risks 
arising from global events such as recessions, embargoes and 
economic uncertainty caused by political events (at present in 
particular the situation in the Middle East) and are responding with 
flexible portfolio management that is tailored to the individual 
situation. That also applies to the current issues that have prevailed 
for several quarters such as the significant increase in the level of 
interest rates and the effects of continued high inflation.

Originator positions 
Commerzbank has in recent years securitised receivables from 
loans to the Bank’s customers with a current volume of €14.7bn for 
capital management purposes (31 December 2022: €12.2bn). As at 
the reporting date 31 December 2023, risk exposures with a value 
of €13.1bn were retained (31 December 2022: €11.3bn). By far the 
largest share of all positions was accounted for by €12.9bn 
(31 December 2021: €11.2bn) on senior tranches, which are almost 
entirely rated good to very good. In the year under review, 
Commerzbank issued two synthetic STS (simple, transparent and 
standardised) securitisations with a volume of €1.75bn and €3.2bn, 
which are mainly based on corporate receivables from Germany and 
other European countries. In addition, Commerzbank’s Polish 
subsidiary, mBank, issued a synthetic STS securitisation with a 
volume of €2.3bn, which is based on receivables from private 
customers.

Conduit exposure and other asset-backed exposures 
The Bank provides financing to securitise receivables, in particular 
trade and leasing receivables, from customers in the Corporate 
Clients segment. In this context, Commerzbank acts mainly as an 
arranger of asset-backed securities transactions via the Commerz-
bank-sponsored multi-seller conduit Silver Tower. The volume and 
risk values for the securitisation of receivables in the Corporate 
Clients segment rose by €1.3bn to €5.2bn in 2023. 
Liquidity risk subsumes the risk that Commerzbank will be 
unable to meet its payment obligations on a day-to-day basis. 
Liquidity risks from securitisations are modelled in the internal 
liquidity risk model on a risk-adjusted basis. In the case of 
transactions subject to variable utilisation, it is assumed that the 
purchase facilities provided to the special-purpose companies must 
be refinanced almost in full by Commerzbank for the duration of 
their term and until the maturity of the last financed receivable. 
Securitisations only qualify as liquid assets if they are eligible for 
rediscount at the European Central Bank. These positions are only 
included in the liquidity risk calculation after risk-adjusted 
discounts are applied. 
The other asset-backed exposures mainly comprise government-
guaranteed asset-backed securities (ABS) held by Commerzbank 
Finance & Covered Bond S.A. and Commerzbank AG in Germany. 
In 2023, the volume declined to €3.0bn (December 2022: €3.4bn), 
as did the risk values1 at €3.0bn (31 December 2022: €3.4bn). 
There are also investments in the Structured Credit area. The 
volume of new investments entered into since 2014 stood at €7.3bn 
(December 2022: €7.1bn). We have invested in bonds of senior 
tranches of securitisation transactions in the consumer (auto) ABS, 
UK RMBS and CLO asset classes, which have a robust structure and 
a moderate risk profile. At 31 December 2023, this portfolio solely 
contained AAA-rated CLO positions (which was also the case at 
31 December 2022). Remaining structured credit positions with a 
volume of €0.2bn were already in the portfolio prior to 2014 
(December 2022: €0.2bn), while risk values stood at €0.1bn 
(December 2022: €0.1bn). 
Forbearance portfolio 
The EBA’s definition of forbearance comprises two requirements, 
which have to be met concurrently: the debtor is having difficulties 
or will probably have difficulties in meeting their financial 
obligations and the measures of the bank to help the debtor include 
concessions to the debtor that the bank would not have agreed to 
under different circumstances. Examples of concessions include 
deferrals, increases in limits or loans and waivers in connection with 
restructuring. The definition of forbearance applies independently 
of whether the debtor is in the performing or the non-performing 
portfolio.  
The following tables show Commerzbank’s total forbearance 
portfolio on the basis of the EBA definition as well as the loan loss 
provisions for these positions:

Market risk is the risk of potential financial losses due to changes in 
market prices (interest rates, commodities, credit spreads, 
exchange rates and equity prices) or in parameters that affect prices 
such as volatilities and correlations. Losses may impact profit or loss 
directly, e.g. in the case of trading book positions. However, for 
banking book positions they are reflected generally in the 
revaluation reserve or in hidden liabilities/reserves. 
Strategy and organisation 
 
Commerzbank’s market risk strategy is derived from its overall risk 
strategy and the business strategies of the individual segments. It 
sets targets for market risk management in relation to 
Commerzbank’s main business activities. The core market risk 
management tasks are the identification of all material market risks 
and drivers of market risk and the independent measurement and 
evaluation of these. Risk-oriented management is based on these 
results and assessments as part of an integrated risk/return-
oriented management. 
The Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank is respon-
sible for ensuring the effective management of market risk through-
out the Commerzbank Group. Specific levels of authority and 
responsibility in relation to market risk management have been 
assigned to the Group Market Risk Committee. 
In the Group Market Risk Committee, segment representatives, 
along with representatives from the risk function and finance area, 
discuss current risk positioning issues and decide on appropriate 
monitoring and control measures. Chaired by the risk function, the 
Group Market Risk Committee, which meets monthly, deals with the 
Commerzbank Group’s market risk position. Discussions centre on 
the monthly market risk report, which is also presented to the Board 
of Managing Directors for their consideration. The report summa-
rises the latest developments relevant to the Bank on financial 
markets, the Bank’s positioning and related risk ratios.  
The risk management process for market risk involves the 
identification, measurement, management and monitoring of risks 
and reporting on them. It is the responsibility in functional terms of 
market risk management, which is independent of trading activities. 
Central market risk management is complemented by decentralised 
market risk management units at segment level and for regional 
units and subsidiaries. The close integration of central and local risk 
management with the business units means that the risk 
management process starts in the trading areas themselves. The 
trading units are responsible in particular for the active 
management of market risk positions, e.g. reduction measures or 
hedging. 
Commerzbank’s risk appetite is determined in the annual 
internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP). A specific 
amount of economically required capital (ErC) is assigned to market 
risk and acts as a limit on market risk. This limit reflects the appetite 
for market risk and is broken down into the various portfolio levels 
for the purpose of operational management. 
Market risk from credit spread volumes represents a significant 
risk for the Bank. Other market risks arise from position volumes 
that react to interest rate changes, at Commerzbank mainly in euros, 
UK pounds and US dollars. In addition, Commerzbank is exposed 
to significant inflation risk, which mainly results from its pension 
fund. Currency and commodity risk are important market risks for 
the Corporate Clients segment. Commodity risk relates in particular 
to transactions in CO2 certificates and precious metals. Equity price 
risk mainly results from equity holdings and the pension fund. 
The economically required capital also takes into account the 
credit spread risk from positions that are measured at amortised 
cost as well as model risks from core deposit models and from 
customer behaviour with regard to early repayments in lending 
business.  
Risk management 
 
Commerzbank uses a wide range of quantitative and qualitative 
tools to manage and monitor market risk. Market risk limits are 
defined for various key figures such as sensitivities, value at risk 
(VaR), stress test results and economic capital metrics. Our 
rulebook, in the form of market risk policies and guidelines as well 
as restrictions on portfolio structure, new products, maturities and 
minimum ratings, establishes the qualitative framework for market 
risk management. The market risk strategy lays down the relevance 
of figures in each segment. Thereby allowance is made for the 
varying impact of the parameters for the management of the 
segments in line with the business strategy. 
Market risk is managed internally at Group level, segment level 
and in each segment’s reporting units. An internal limit system 
broken down to portfolio level is implemented and forms a core part 
of internal market risk management. 
The quantitative and qualitative factors limiting market risk are 
determined by the market risk committees by reference to the 
Group’s management of economic capital. The utilisation of these 
limits, together with the relevant net income figures, is reported 
daily to the Board of Managing Directors and the responsible heads 
of the Group divisions. Based on qualitative analyses and quanti-
tative ratios, the market risk function identifies potential future risks, 
anticipates potential financial losses in collaboration with the 
finance function, and draws up proposals for further action, which 
are discussed with the front office units. Voting on the proposed 
measures or risk positions takes place in the above-mentioned 
market risk committee and is subsequently submitted to the Board 
of Managing Directors for approval.

Risk concentrations are restricted directly using specific limits or 
are indirectly avoided, for example, using stress test limits. In 
addition, the combination of various conventional risk measures (e.g. 
VaR, sensitivities) ensures the appropriate management of 
concentration risks. Furthermore, risk drivers are analysed on a 
regular basis in order to identify concentrations. The risk manage-
ment of existing concentrations is also reviewed using situation-
driven analyses and, where necessary, supplemented by targeted 
measures such as limits.  
Any limits that are breached are handled in a separate escalation 
procedure. After a limit breach has been identified, the front office 
and risk units design adequate countermeasures. If the limit breach 
cannot be remedied within a reasonable period, it will be escalated 
by the market risk function to the next hierarchical level. 
Regulatory risk measures that are not included in economic risk-
bearing capacity are limited and managed separately. These include, 
for example, stressed VaR and incremental risk charge.  
In internal management, positions relevant to market risk in the 
trading book and the banking book are managed jointly. In addition, 
for regulatory purposes the trading book is managed separately (in 
accordance with regulatory requirements, including currency and 
commodity risks in the banking book) and interest rate risks in the 
banking book are managed on a stand-alone basis. In order to 
provide a consistent presentation in this report, all figures relating 
to VaR are based on a confidence level of 99%, a holding period of 
one day, equally weighted market data and a 254-day history. The 
internal VaR model is based on a historical simulation. 
Trading book 
 
Below, we show how the regulatory market risk ratios of the trading 
book portfolio developed. Most of Commerzbank’s trading book 
positions derive from the Corporate Clients segment and Group 
Treasury division. The VaR figures comprise all risks in the internal 
VaR model. Commerzbank subsidiaries use standardised approaches 
for their regulatory capital calculation under partial use rules. They 
are not included in the regulatory VaR figures presented. 
The VaR increased slightly to €14m as at 31 December 2023 
(31 December 2022: €13m).

Further risk ratios are calculated for regulatory capital adequacy. 
This includes the calculation of stressed VaR. Stressed VaR is 
calculated using the internal model on the basis of the VaR method 
described above. The main difference lies in the market data used 
to value the assets. Stressed VaR measures the risk in the present 
position in the trading book by reference to market movements from 
a specified crisis period in the past. The crisis observation period 
used for this is checked regularly through model validation and 
approval processes and adjusted where necessary. The crisis 
observation period remained the same during the year. 
The market risk profile in stressed VaR is also distributed across 
the various asset classes. The dominant asset classes are interest 
rates and commodities. The decrease in stressed VaR resulted in 
particular from changes in positions in the Corporate Clients 
segment and from changes in currency risk relating to the pension 
fund and equity holdings.

In addition, the incremental risk charge and the equity event VaR 
figures (components of the VaR calculation) quantify the risk of 
deterioration in creditworthiness and event risks in trading book 
positions. The incremental risk charge rose from €39m to €76m in 
the course of 2023. The increase was due to trading activities in the 
Corporate Clients segment in the context of hedging transactions 
for counterparty risks. The equity event VaR is part of the VaR 
calculation. 
The reliability of the internal model (historical simulation) is 
monitored in various ways, including backtesting on a daily basis. 
The VaR calculated is set against actually occurring changes in the 
portfolio value (profits and losses). In the process, a distinction is 
made between the variants backtesting of the hypothetical change 
in portfolio value (clean P&L) and backtesting of the actual change 
in portfolio value (dirty P&L). In the former, exactly the same 
positions in the income statement are used as were used for 
calculating the VaR. This means that the profits and losses result 
only from changes in market prices (hypothetical changes in the 
portfolio value). In dirty P&L backtesting, by contrast, profits and 
losses from newly concluded and expired transactions from the day 
under consideration are also included (actual profits and losses 
induced by portfolio value changes). Profits and losses from 
valuation adjustments and model reserves are factored into dirty 
and clean P&L according to the regulatory requirements.  
If the actual loss exceeds the VaR, it is described as a negative 
backtesting outlier. Analysing the results of backtesting provides an 
informative basis for checking parameters and for potential 
improvement to the market risk model. In the 2023 financial year, 
no negative clean P&L outliers and no negative dirty P&L outliers 
were measured at Group level.  
Backtesting is also used by the supervisory authorities for 
evaluating internal risk models. Negative outliers are classified by 
means of a traffic-light system laid down by the supervisory 
authorities. All negative backtesting outliers at Group level (from 
both clean P&L and dirty P&L) must be reported to the supervisory 
authorities, citing their extent and cause. 
As the VaR concept gives a prediction of potential losses 
assuming normal market conditions, it is supplemented by stress 
tests. These stress tests for the whole portfolio (banking book and 
trading book) measure the risk to which Commerzbank is exposed, 
based on unlikely but still plausible events. These events may be 
simulated using extreme movements on various financial markets. 
The key scenarios relate to major changes in credit spreads, interest 
rates and yield curves, exchange rates, share prices and commo-
dities prices. Examples of events simulated in stress tests include all 
stock prices falling by 15%, a parallel shift in the yield curve and 
changes to the curve’s gradient. 
Extensive Group-wide stress tests and scenario analyses are 
carried out as part of risk monitoring. 
The internal model’s individual components are validated at 
regular intervals to assess their appropriateness for risk measure-
ment. The identification and elimination of model weaknesses are 
of particular importance in this. 
Banking book 
 
The key drivers of market risk in the banking book are the Group 
Treasury portfolios, with their credit spread, interest rate and basis 
risks. 
In market risk management, credit spread sensitivities in the 
banking and trading books are considered together. Credit spread 
sensitivities (downshift of 1 basis point) for all securities and 
derivative positions (excluding loans and pension funds) were 
almost unchanged at €30m as at the end of 2023 (31 December 
2022: €30m).  
Most credit spread sensitivities related to securities positions 
measured at amortised cost. Changes in market price have no 
impact on the revaluation reserve or the income statement for these 
positions. The impact of an interest rate shock on the economic 
value of the Group’s banking book is simulated monthly in 
compliance with regulatory requirements. In accordance with the 
EU Banking Directive, the German Federal Financial Supervisory 
Authority and the European Central Bank have prescribed two 
scenarios of uniform, sudden and unexpected changes in interest 
rates (+/–200 basis points) to be used by all banks, which have to 
report on the results of this stress test every quarter. In the scenario 
–200 basis points, the yield curve is floored at 0 (negative sections 
of the yield curve are left unchanged). 
As a result of the scenario +200 basis points, a potential economic 
loss of €2,061m as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 
€2,062m potential economic loss) was determined, and in the 
scenario –200 basis points a potential economic profit of €1,169m 
(31 December 2022: €1,133m potential economic profit). Commerz-
bank does not, therefore, need to be classified as a bank with 
elevated interest rate risk, as the decline in net present value 
represents less than 20% of its regulatory capital. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
244 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
The interest rate sensitivity of the overall banking book 
(excluding pension funds) fell slightly to €2.0m as at 31 December 
2023 (31 December 2022: €2.4m) per basis point of interest rate 
decline.  
Pension fund risk is also part of market risk in the banking book. 
Our pension fund portfolio comprises a diversified investment 
section and the insurance-related liabilities. The duration of the 
liabilities is extremely long (cash outflows modelled over almost 90 
years), and the main portion of the overall portfolio’s present value 
risk is in maturities of 15 years and over. The main risk drivers are 
long-term euro interest rates, credit spreads and expected euro 
inflation due to anticipated pension dynamics. Equity, volatility and 
foreign exchange risk also need to be taken into consideration. 
Diversification effects between individual risks reduce the overall 
risk. The extremely long maturities of these liabilities represent the 
greatest challenge, particularly for hedging credit spread risk. This 
is because there is insufficient liquidity in the market for 
corresponding hedging products. 
Market liquidity risk 
 
Market liquidity risk is the risk of the Bank not being able to 
liquidate or hedge risky positions in a timely manner, to the desired 
extent and on acceptable terms as a result of insufficient liquidity in 
the market.  
Market liquidity risk is taken into account in Commerzbank’s 
risk-bearing capacity concept by scaling the value at risk to one year, 
i.e. the implicitly recognised liquidation period. Additional valuation 
adjustments (prudent valuation) for market liquidity risk are also 
reflected in the calculation of the risk coverage capital. As part of 
the prudent valuation calculation, the liquidity horizon among other 
things is used to determine the amount of the capital deduction 
items.

We define liquidity risk in the narrower sense as the risk that 
Commerzbank will be unable to meet its payment obligations on a 
day-to-day basis. In a broader sense, liquidity risk describes the risk 
that future payments cannot be funded for the full amount, in the 
required currency or at standard market conditions, as and when 
they are due. 
Strategy and organisation 
 
The Board of Managing Directors adopts the business strategy and 
the Bank’s risk tolerance, which is associated with it. The business 
strategies for 2024 and 2027 and the potential risks resulting from 
them are described in the section Overall bank management: Risk 
strategy and risk management. 
Liquidity risk tolerance is then operationalised by defining the 
liquidity reserve period and the limit framework. In order to ensure 
an appropriate liquidity risk management process, the Board of 
Managing 
Directors 
delegates 
certain 
competences 
and 
responsibilities in connection with the Group-wide liquidity risk 
strategy to the Risk and Treasury functions.  
The Group Asset Liability Committee (Group ALCO) is 
responsible for the integrated management of financial resources, 
in particular for strategic and structural liquidity decisions. The 
Group ALCO is supported by various sub-committees in this. 
Risk management 
 
Commerzbank uses a wide range of tools to manage and monitor 
liquidity risks on the basis of its own liquidity risk model. The stress 
scenario within the Bank that underlies the model and is relevant 
for management purposes allows for the impact of both a bank-
specific stress event and a broader market crisis. Binding regulatory 
requirements are an integral component of the management 
mechanism.  
Group Treasury is responsible for the Group’s liquidity 
management operations. Group Treasury is represented in all major 
locations of the Group in Germany and abroad and has reporting 
lines into all subsidiaries. Commerzbank manages its global 
liquidity centrally using cash pooling. This approach seeks to 
ensure that liquidity resources are used efficiently and that this 
occurs across all time zones, as Group Treasury units are located in 
Frankfurt, London, New York and Singapore. Additional information 
on this subject can be found in the “Funding and liquidity of the 
Commerzbank Group” section of the Group management report. 
Liquidity risk is monitored on the basis of the Bank’s own 
liquidity risk model by the independent risk function. 
The Bank has established early warning indicators for the 
purpose of managing liquidity risk. These ensure that appropriate 
steps can be taken in good time to secure long-term financial 
solidity. 
Risk concentrations can lead to increased outflows of liquidity, 
particularly in a stress situation, and thus to increased liquidity risk. 
They can, for example, occur with regard to maturities, large 
individual creditors or currencies. By means of ongoing monitoring 
and reporting, emerging risk concentrations in funding can be 
recognised in a timely manner and mitigated through suitable 
measures. 
Foreign currency risks and payment obligations in foreign 
currencies are monitored on the basis of established liquidity risk 
limits. The Bank also mitigates concentration by continuously using 
its access to broadly diversified sources of funding, in particular 
diverse customer deposits and capital market instruments.  
In the event of a market-driven and/or idiosyncratic liquidity 
crisis, the liquidity contingency plan provides for certain measures 
which, depending on the nature of the crisis, can be initiated either 
through Treasury’s extended authority to act or through the 
recovery process of the recovery plan. The liquidity contingency 
plan is an independent part of emergency planning and upstream 
of the recovery plan. Both the liquidity contingency plan and the 
recovery plan at Commerzbank are updated at least once a year; the 
individual measures of the recovery plan are checked regularly 
during the year for plausibility. The liquidity contingency plan also 
defines a clear allocation of responsibilities for the processes to be 
followed in emergency situations and gives details of any action that 
may need to be taken. 
Liquidity risk model 
 
A key component of liquidity risk management is the daily 
calculation of the liquidity gap profile. The liquidity gap profile 
shows the deterministic or stochastic inflows and outflows expected 
in the future on a given reporting date and across all portfolios. This 
forms the basis for calculating liquidity requirements or excess 
liquidity per maturity band. This also includes modelling the 
proportion of customer deposits that will be permanently available, 
known as the core deposit base. 
 
 
 
Liquidity risk  
 
 
 
 
 
 
246 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
The liquidity gap profile is also used to set the issuance strategy 
of the Commerzbank Group, which is operationalised by the Group 
Treasury division. The Group Finance division is responsible for 
calculating and allocating liquidity costs on the basis of the liquidity 
gap profile, which are then incorporated in the management of the 
segments’ business activities. 
Based on the liquidity gap profile, management mechanisms 
such as recovery and early warning indicators are limited and 
monitored accordingly. The liquidity gap profile is limited in the 
maturity bands up to 1 year. The Group limits are broken down into 
individual Group units and currencies. The internal liquidity risk 
model is complemented by the regular analysis of additional 
adverse, reverse and historical stress scenarios. 
Quantification and stress testing 
 
Commerzbank uses a wide range of tools to manage and monitor 
liquidity risks on the basis of its own liquidity risk model. In addition 
to internal economic considerations, liquidity risk modelling also 
factors in the binding regulatory requirements under the Capital 
Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the requirements of the Mini-
mum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk). Commerzbank 
incorporates this within its liquidity risk framework, thereby 
quantifying the liquidity risk appetite established by the Board of 
Managing Directors.  
The stress scenarios within the Bank that underlie the model and 
are relevant for management purposes allow for the impact of both 
a bank-specific stress event and a broader market crisis. The 
Commerzbank-specific idiosyncratic scenario simulates a stress 
situation arising from a rating downgrade of two notches, whereas 
the market-wide scenario is derived from experience of the 
subprime crisis of 2007–2008 and simulates an external market-
wide shock. The main liquidity risk drivers of both scenarios are a 
markedly increased outflow of short-term customer deposits, 
above-average drawdown of credit lines, prolongations of lending 
business regarded as commercially necessary, the need to provide 
additional collateral for secured transactions and the application of 
higher risk discounts to the liquidation values of assets. 
As a complement to the individual scenarios, the Bank also 
simulates the impact on the liquidity gap profile (net liquidity 
position) of a scenario that combines idiosyncratic and market-
specific effects. The liquidity gap profile is shown for the whole of 
the modelling horizon across the full spectrum of maturities and 
follows a multi-level concept. This allows for a nuanced presentation 
– deterministic and modelled cash flows in existing business on the 
one hand and the inclusion of prolongations on the other. 
The table below shows the liquidity gap profile values after 
application of the respective stress scenarios for periods of one and 
three months as at the end of the year. Significantly more liquidity 
flows out in a combined scenario compared with the individual 
scenarios. As at the end of 2023, in the one-month and three-month 
periods, the combined stress scenario leaves net liquidity of 
€27.0bn and €22.2bn respectively.

Liquidity reserves 
 
Significant factors in the liquidity risk appetite include the reserve 
period, the size of the liquidity reserve portfolio held to compensate 
for unexpected short-term liquidity outflows, and the limits in the 
various maturity bands. As the liquidity reserve portfolio consists of 
highly liquid assets, it functions as a buffer in stress situations. The 
liquidity reserve portfolio is funded in line with the liquidity risk 
appetite to ensure that it is kept at the required size throughout the 
entire reserve period stipulated by the Board of Managing Directors, 
which extends beyond the reserve period required for regulatory 
purposes.  
Part of this liquidity reserve is held in a separate stress liquidity 
reserve portfolio managed by Group Treasury to cover liquidity 
outflows should a stress event occur and to ensure solvency at all 
times. The amount of the stress liquidity reserve portfolio is checked 
and, if necessary, adjusted as part of the daily liquidity risk 
calculation.  
The Bank also holds an intraday liquidity reserve portfolio. As at 
the 2023 reporting date, the total value of this portfolio was €6.1bn 
(31 December 2022: €6.1bn). 
As at the end of 2023, the Bank had highly liquid assets of 
€134.3bn. This liquidity reserve is funded in line with the liquidity 
risk appetite to ensure that it is kept at the required size throughout 
the entire reserve period stipulated by the Board of Managing 
Directors, which extends beyond the reserve period required for 
regulatory purposes.

Liquidity ratios 
 
Throughout the 2023 financial year, Commerzbank’s internal 
liquidity ratios, including the regulatory liquidity coverage ratio 
(LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), were above the limits 
set at least annually by the Board of Managing Directors.  
The LCR is calculated as the ratio of liquid assets to net liquidity 
outflows under stressed conditions. It is used to measure whether a 
bank has a large enough liquidity buffer to independently withstand 
any potential imbalance between inflows and outflows of liquidity 
under stressed conditions over a period of 30 calendar days.  
As at the reporting date, Commerzbank significantly exceeded 
the required minimum LCR ratio of 100% with a ratio of 145.4% 
(31 December 2022: 145.9%). At 136.2%, the average of the last 
12 month-end values was also well above the minimum ratio (as at 
the end of 2022: 141.1%).  
The Bank has established corresponding limits and early warn-
ing indicators to ensure the LCR minimum requirements are met. 
The NSFR describes the regulatory requirement of stable 
refinancing as a ratio of the amount of the available stable refinanc-
ing and the amount of the required stable refinancing over a one-
year horizon. 
The NSFR itself is defined as the ratio of the weighted available 
stable refinancing and the necessary weighted stable refinancing. It 
must be at least 100%. 
As at 31 December 2023, the NSFR was 130.2% (31 December 
2022: 128.3%) and is thus well above the minimum ratio.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Commerzbank defines operational risk (OpRisk) as the risk of loss 
resulting from the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, 
people and systems or from external events. This definition includes, 
among other things, legal risk, human resources risk, IT risk, 
outsourcing risk, supplier risk and tax risk, as well as operational 
and organisational risk. In this definition the focus is not on 
strategic or reputational risk. In view of their increased economic 
significance, compliance risk and cyber risk are managed as 
separate risk types. However, losses from compliance risks and 
cyber risks are incorporated into the model for determining the 
economic capital required for operational risks.  
Strategy and organisation 
 
Within Commerzbank, OpRisk and governance issues of the Internal 
Control System (ICS) are closely connected in terms of both 
organisational structure and methodology and are continuously 
being enhanced. This is because many OpRisk cases are closely 
linked with failures in the control mechanisms. A properly 
functioning ICS thereby helps to reduce or avoid losses from 
operational risks and thus to lower the amount of economic capital 
required to cover operational risks in the medium to long term.  
Commerzbank’s ICS is based on the internationally applicable 
“COSO I”1 framework developed by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  
Implementation at Commerzbank took place in 2010 in the form 
of an annual ICS control cycle on the basis of minimum standards, 
and this is continually being optimised in risk-based fashion and 
adapted in line with current circumstances and Group structures. 
Conversely, the operational risk management systems enable 
the ICS to adapt itself consistently to them. The further development 
of the ICS structure is an essential aspect of the proactive reduction 
or prevention of operational risks.  
The ICS at Commerzbank can again be classified as “appropriate” 
and “effective” overall in the 2023 financial year.  
Chaired by the CRO, the Group OpRisk Committee meets at least 
four times a year and deals with the management of operational 
risks within the Commerzbank Group. It also acts as the escalation 
and decision-making committee for key OpRisk topics that span all 
areas. The Group OpRisk Committee and/or the Segment Commit-
tees with responsibility for operational risk deal with the manage-
ment of operational risk in the relevant units. They analyse OpRisk 
issues that affect them, such as loss events, and define subsequent 
measures or recommend action. 
Commerzbank’s OpRisk strategy is approved on an annual basis 
by the Board of Managing Directors after it has been discussed and 
voted upon in the Group OpRisk Committee. The OpRisk strategy 
describes the risk profile, key elements of the desired risk culture, 
its management framework and measures to be taken by Commerz-
bank to manage operational risk. OpRisk management is based on 
three consecutive levels (three lines of defence) which, when taken 
together, are crucial for reaching the given strategic aims. The 
segments and management/service units constitute the first line of 
defence. They are directly responsible for identifying and managing 
risks in their respective areas of responsibility. The specified risk 
standards and policies must be adhered to. The second line of 
defence sets standards for appropriate risk management for the 
relevant risk type, ensures the implementation of these standards 
and carries out suitable monitoring. It conducts analyses and 
assessments of the risks. The third line of defence is Internal Audit. 
It is tasked with independently auditing the Bank’s processes and 
safeguards, and as such also assesses the activities of the first and 
second lines of defence. 
The operational risk strategy defines overarching focus topics 
and also sets further individual strategic objectives for each sub-risk 
type (see the section Sub-risk types of operational risk). One of the 
focus topics for 2024 is the implementation of the new provisions of 
the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR III), which come into 
force on 1 January 2025. In this context, a new standardised 
approach for calculating OpRisk RWA and new reporting require-
ments will be introduced. The focus is also on analysing and 
implementing the requirements of DORA (Digital Operational 
Resilience Act), in particular the definition and establishment of ICT 
risk management within the organisation. Other topics include 
optimising the monitoring of non-financial risk (NFR), introducing 
a holistic approach to managing risk for all types of third parties and 
optimising digital banking processes in order to detect and prevent 
external fraudulent activities at an early stage.  
In order to meet the requirements of the ECB’s “Guide on 
climate-related and environmental risks” for banks by the end of 
2024, the measurement and assessment of environmental (ESG) 
risks will be further developed. A focus in 2024 will be on an 
optimised mapping of biodiversity risk across all risk management 
activities.
 
Operational risk 
1 The COSO I model is an internationally recognised standard for documenting, 
analysing and designing an internal control system. The definition of the control 
model encompasses the following core objectives to be met: effectiveness and 
efficiency of business processes, reliability of reporting, and adherence to applicable 
laws and regulations (compliance).

Risk management 
 
Commerzbank takes an active approach to managing operational 
risk, aiming to systematically identify OpRisk profiles and risk 
concentrations and to define, prioritise and implement risk 
mitigation measures.  
Operational risks are characterised by asymmetric distribution 
of losses. This means that most of the losses are relatively small, 
while isolated losses with a very low probability of occurrence have 
the potential to be large and devastating. This makes it necessary 
not only to limit high loss potential but also to proactively manage 
losses that can be expected to occur frequently. 
To do this, Commerzbank has set up a multi-stage system that 
brings together the defined limits on economic capital (risk capacity) 
and those set for operative risk management during the year (risk 
appetite/tolerance), complemented by rules on the transparent and 
conscious acceptance and approval of individual risks (risk 
acceptance). 
OpRisk management includes an annual evaluation of the Bank’s 
ICS key controls and a risk scenario assessment. OpRisk loss events 
are also subject to ongoing analysis and ICS backtesting on an 
event-driven basis. Lessons learned activities are carried out after 
all material loss events.  
Since the fourth quarter of 2021 Commerzbank has measured 
regulatory capital using the standardised approach (SA), while 
economic capital for operational risks continues to be measured 
using a dedicated internal model (OpRisk ErC model, based on the 
previous AMA (advanced measurement approach)). Risk-weighted 
assets for operational risks on this basis came to €22.8bn at the end 
of the fourth quarter of 2023 (31 December 2022: €21.2bn). The 
main reason for the increase compared with the previous year was 
provisional revenues in 2023. The economically required capital 
was €2.2bn. A comparison with the previous year (31 December 
2022: €2.3bn) shows no significant change.  
The following table gives an overview of risk-weighted assets 
and the economically required capital (ErC) by segment:

The total charge for OpRisk events as at the end of the fourth quarter 
of 2023 was approximately €1,176m (full-year 2022: €951m). The 
events mainly related to losses in the “Products and business 
practices” category. First and foremost, the losses and provisions at 
mBank for legal risks in connection with loans indexed in Swiss 
francs should be mentioned here.

A structured, centralised and decentralised reporting system ensures 
that the members of the OpRisk Committee, the segments and the 
supervisory bodies are informed regularly, promptly and fully about 
operational risk. Detailed and extensive OpRisk reports are prepared 
on a quarterly basis. They contain changes in OpRisk losses, the 
segments’ main loss events, current risk analyses, changes in the 
capital requirement, changes in ESG risk, changes in non-financial 
risk and the status of measures implemented.  
Operational risks are also part of the regular risk reporting 
process to the Board of Managing Directors and to the Supervisory 
Board’s Risk Committee.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Sub-risk types of operational risk 
 
The risks listed below are the sub-risk types of operational risk 
included in Commerzbank’s risk inventory. 
Legal risk 
Legal risk primarily arises for the Commerzbank Group when the 
Bank’s claims cannot be enforced for legal reasons or when claims 
can be made against the Bank because the underlying law was not 
observed or has changed since a transaction was concluded. 
The operation of banking and financial services transactions that 
are subject to regulatory provisions may also result in legal risk. 
This risk may also take the form of orders or sanctions issued or 
imposed by one or more authorities whose supervision Commerz-
bank is subject to anywhere in the world. Legal risk also arises in 
realised losses or provisions due to or in connection with court 
cases brought against Commerzbank (passive proceedings). Cases 
brought by Commerzbank (active proceedings) generally represent 
a credit risk rather than an operational risk, so the risk of loss is 
already taken into account through write-downs. However, the costs 
of legal action (court and lawyers’ costs) for active proceedings are 
classified as legal risk. 
Organisation 
Within Commerzbank, the functional management of legal risk 
throughout the Group is the responsibility of Group Legal as the 
second line of defence. All legal staff at the various Group Legal 
locations including the foreign branches as well as the legal staff of 
the legal departments of the domestic and foreign subsidiaries are 
as legal risk managers operationally responsible for the 
identification and management of the Group-wide legal risk within 
Commerzbank. 
Risk management 
The task of the Group’s legal risk managers is to detect legal risks 
and all losses potentially resulting from them at an early stage, to 
highlight possible solutions that might avoid or minimise such 
losses, and to play an active part in reaching decisions concerning 
legal risks. They must ensure that they are always up to date with 
all legal changes or new findings within their area of responsibility 
and inform the business units affected about the impact on legal 
risk and any action that needs to be taken as a result. 
The legal risk managers are responsible for arranging or 
adjusting legal provisions and look after and monitor new and 
ongoing court proceedings.  
In the case of passive proceedings, provisions are recognised on 
the basis of the risk assessment carried out by the responsible legal 
risk manager. To determine the amount of the provisions for the 
claim, the legal risk manager makes the best possible estimate of 
the probable loss (in cash / cash outflow) from the proceedings. The 
provisions for the claim must be recognised in the amount of this 
expected loss if the outflow of resources is probable. The legal risk 
manager must review the probability of occurrence and the 
expected loss in the event of new findings, particularly after each 
significant stage of the proceedings, and adjust the provisions for 
the claim accordingly. In the case of active proceedings, provisions 
are usually only recognised for the expected court and lawyers’ 
costs.  
Group Legal provides information about all major court 
proceedings and risk trends in a quarterly litigation report. This 
report is sent to the Bank’s management and Supervisory Board, 
the supervisory authority and the OpRisk Committee. 
Current developments 
Commerzbank and its subsidiaries are involved in a variety of court 
and arbitration cases, claims and official investigations (legal 
proceedings) in connection with a broad range of issues. They 
include, for example, allegations of defective advice, disputes in 
connection 
with 
credit 
finance 
or 
payment 
transactions, 
entitlements to occupational pensions, allegedly false accounting 
and incorrect financial statements, enforcement of claims due to tax 
issues, allegedly incorrect prospectuses in connection with 
underwriting transactions, alleged violations of competition laws, 
and cases brought by shareholders and other investors as well as 
investigations by supervisory authorities. Applicable sanctions 
regimes may result in Commerzbank or its subsidiaries being 
prevented from fulfilling obligations towards customers or business 
partners; as a result, Commerzbank and its subsidiaries may be 
subject to legal action. In addition, changes to rulings by supreme 
courts, which may render them more restrictive, as well as to legal 
conditions, e.g. in the private customer business, may result in more 
claims being brought against Commerzbank or its subsidiaries. In 
these court cases, claimants are mostly asking for the payment of 
compensation, claims on account of unjust enrichment or the 
reversal of agreements already entered into. If the courts were to 
find in favour of one or more of the claimants in these cases, 
Commerzbank could be liable to pay compensation, which could in 
some cases be substantial, or could incur the expense of reversing 
agreements or of other cost-intensive measures.

Regulatory authorities and governmental institutions in various 
countries in which Commerzbank and its subsidiaries are or have 
been active have for some years been investigating irregularities in 
connection with the fixing of foreign exchange rates and with foreign 
exchange business in general. In the course of these investigations, 
supervisory authorities and governmental institutions have also 
sought checks on Commerzbank or have approached the Bank with 
requests for information. Commerzbank has cooperated fully with 
these bodies and also looked into the relevant matters on the basis 
of its own comprehensive investigations. The cases are no longer 
active with the exception of one case in which the investigating 
authority transferred the matter to the national competition tribunal. 
Financial consequences cannot be ruled out.  
The public prosecutor’s office in Frankfurt is investigating equity 
transactions conducted by Commerzbank and the former Dresdner 
Bank around the dividend record date (cum-ex transactions). 
Commerzbank had already initiated a forensic analysis of cum-ex 
transactions at the end of 2015, which was concluded at the start of 
2018 in respect of Commerzbank’s equity transactions and in 
September 2019 in respect of the equity transactions of the former 
Dresdner Bank. All back taxes demanded by the tax authorities have 
been paid. 
The public prosecutor’s office in Cologne has been conducting 
investigations at Commerzbank since September 2019 in connec-
tion with a separate case concerning cum-ex transactions. It is 
investigating on suspicion that the Bank (including Dresdner Bank) 
was involved in cum-ex transactions in various roles, including by 
supplying shares to third parties who were allegedly acting as short 
sellers. According to the current understanding, these proceedings 
do not involve Commerzbank’s own tax credit claims with regard to 
capital gains tax and the solidarity surcharge on dividends.  
The Bank is cooperating fully with authorities conducting 
investigations into cum-ex transactions. It is currently not possible 
to predict whether this will result in a burden, whether it will occur, 
or the amount of any resulting burden. 
Based on the circular on cum/cum transactions published by the 
Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2017, the tax auditors 
commented on the treatment of these transactions in the form of 
audit notes. The tax office reduced the credit for capital gains taxes 
accordingly. In response, Commerzbank made value adjustments to 
tax credits shown in the balance sheet and set up additional 
provisions for possible repayment claims in order to reflect the 
changed risk situation fully and appropriately. The BMF published 
a revised version of its circular on cum/cum transactions on 9 July 
2021. In view of the potential impact of the BMF circular, the 
provision was adjusted in the second quarter of 2021. Based on 
current knowledge, the tax risks arising from this issue have thereby 
been adequately covered. The possibility of further charges over 
and above the provisions recognised by the Bank cannot be 
completely ruled out. 
With respect to securities lending transactions, Commerzbank is 
exposed to compensation claims (including in court) from third 
parties for crediting entitlements that have been denied. In the 
context of these securities lending transactions, the contracting 
parties were obliged to reimburse Commerzbank for dividends and 
withholding tax. However, the tax offices of various contracting 
parties partially refused or subsequently disallowed subsequent 
crediting against corporate income tax. 
In May 2017, a Polish court admitted a class action lawsuit 
against mBank alleging the ineffectiveness of index clauses in loan 
agreements denominated in Swiss francs. A total of 1,731 plaintiffs 
have joined the class action. The plaintiffs appealed against the 
claim’s dismissal by the court of first instance. In January 2024, the 
court of appeal referred the case back to the court of first instance 
for a new hearing. 
Independently of this, numerous borrowers of loans indexed in 
foreign currencies have also filed individual lawsuits for the same 
reasons. In addition to the class action, 22,602 other individual 
proceedings were pending as at 31 December 2023 (31 Decem-
ber 2022: 17,627). mBank has contested these claims.  
As at 31 December 2023, there were 4,528 final rulings relating 
to loans indexed in foreign currencies in individual proceedings 
against mBank, of which 104 were decided in favour of mBank and 
4,424 were decided against mBank.  
The questions submitted to the ECJ by the Polish Supreme Court 
on the legality of the process for appointing new judges to the Polish 
Supreme Court are still unanswered and the further course of the 
proceedings and the outcome remain to be seen. 
In a request for a preliminary ruling from a Polish court to the 
ECJ in proceedings concerning mBank (C-140/22), the ECJ ruled in 
December 2023 that a consumer can choose not to assert unfairness 
of a contractual term and voluntarily agree to the contractual term, 
but is not obliged to assert the unfairness in court in order to 
enforce their rights. The ECJ also reaffirmed its case law from the 
ruling of 15 June 2023 (C-520/21) and rejected claims by the bank 
beyond the repayment of capital and the payment of statutory 
default interest. 
In proceedings against another bank (C-28/22), the ECJ ruled in 
December 2023 that the limitation period must be symmetrical for 
both parties; the limitation period for customer claims must not 
begin before the limitation period for the banks’ claims. The court 
also ruled that interest on arrears would continue to accrue during 
the period in which the bank exercised a right of retention.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
In a referral proceeding against another bank (C-756/22), 
questions were referred to the ECJ regarding the bank’s claims in 
the event of the reversal of loans; in its decision in December 2023, 
the ECJ referred to its ruling of 15 June 2023 (C-520/21) and 
confirmed that the bank has no claim against the consumer beyond 
the repayment of the capital and statutory default interest.  
In a referral proceeding at the ECJ concerning mBank (C-488/23), 
a decision was issued in January 2024 in which the court confirmed 
its ruling of 15 June 2023 (C-520/21), according to which a bank is 
not entitled to remuneration for the transfer of capital, not even in 
the form of compensation for the loss in value of the capital 
transferred (“valorisation”). 
mBank established a settlement programme beginning in the 
fourth quarter of 2022 that is aimed at all customers with active 
loans indexed in Swiss francs, including those who already have 
lawsuits against the bank. Customers will be offered the option of 
having their loans converted into zloty loans with a fixed or variable 
interest rate as well as the cancellation of an individually negotiated 
part of the outstanding loan value. As at the reporting date, mBank 
had accounted for risks in connection with future settlement 
payments in the amount of €285.7m. 
mBank has looked into the implications of the ECJ’s rulings and 
decisions and has examined and partly adjusted the parameters of 
the model, such as the expected number of borrowers who will still 
sue, the nature of the expected court judgements, the amount of the 
Bank’s loss in the event of a judgement and the acceptance rate for 
settlements. The methodology used to calculate the provision is 
based on parameters that are varied, discretionary and in some 
cases associated with considerable uncertainty. Fluctuations in the 
parameters as well as their interdependencies and rulings of the 
Polish courts and the ECJ may mean that the amount of the 
provision has to be adjusted significantly in the future. 
As at 31 December 2023, the portfolio of loans indexed in for-
eign currencies that have not been fully repaid had a carrying 
amount of 3.4bn Polish zloty. The portfolio of fully repaid loans and 
loans for which a settlement had been agreed or final ruling had 
been issued amounted to 11.2bn Polish zloty at the time of disburse-
ment. Overall, the Group recognised a provision of €1.9bn for the 
risks arising from the matter, including potential settlement pay-
ments and the class action lawsuit (31 December 2022: €1.4bn), 
this relates almost exclusively to loans indexed in Swiss francs. In 
the case of loans that have not yet been fully repaid, the legal risks 
are taken into account in the gross carrying amounts of the receiv-
ables directly when estimating the cash flows, and not shown as a 
provision. 
In April 2021, the German Federal Court of Justice ruled on the 
mechanism for changes to banks’ general terms and conditions 
(AGB Banken) in a case against another bank and declared the 
relevant clauses of the general terms and conditions to be void. This 
mechanism stipulated that the customer’s consent to certain 
changes in the contract was given after a certain period of time if 
the customer had not objected. The Bank has examined the impact 
of this case law on its business units and products, as the charges 
introduced or increased for consumers as a result of the mechanism 
for changes to banks’ general terms and conditions may be void. 
Some of these cases could also have an impact on the reputation 
of Commerzbank and its subsidiaries. The Group recognises 
provisions for such proceedings if liabilities are likely to result from 
them and the amounts to which the Group is likely to be liable can 
be determined with sufficient accuracy. Since there are 
considerable uncertainties as to how such proceedings will develop, 
the possibility cannot be ruled out that some of the provisions 
recognised for them may prove to be inadequate once the courts’ 
final rulings are known. As a result, substantial additional expense 
may be incurred. This is also true in the case of legal proceedings 
for which the Group did not consider it necessary to recognise 
provisions. The eventual outcome of some legal proceedings might 
have an impact on Commerzbank’s results and cash flow in a given 
reporting period; in the worst case, it cannot be fully ruled out that 
the liabilities which might result from them may also have a 
significant impact on Commerzbank’s earnings performance, assets 
and financial position. 
Further information on legal proceedings may be found in Note 
54 regarding provisions and Note 56 regarding contingent liabilities 
and lending commitments in the Group financial statements. 
Operational and organisational risk 
Through its written rules of procedure, Commerzbank has a defined 
framework for its organisational structure and processes. These 
rules are based on legal requirements, including the Minimum 
Requirements for Risk Management of Credit Institutions (MaRisk), 
section AT5 Organisational guidelines, and on Commerzbank’s 
strategy and constitution. 
The rules for the organisational structure include uniform and 
binding minimum requirements for the Bank’s structure and they 
thereby allocate responsibilities clearly. The core elements are the 
assignment of responsibilities for the Board of Managing Directors, 
the business objectives with the descriptions of the tasks of the 
corporate units, and the administrative cost approval authorities for 
the different management levels.

For organisational processes, standards are set for the creation, 
regular updating, approval and documentation of instructions and 
processes as well as the systems to be used. 
Regular reviews of up-to-date status are carried out for both 
components. The managers responsible for risk are involved 
through approval processes and are thus informed about any 
changes in risks. 
This creates overall certainty for the work of all standard-setting 
functions and employees. 
IT risk 
In our internal definition, we define IT risk as risks to the security 
of information processed in our systems in terms of meeting the 
four IT security objectives set out below: 
Confidentiality: Information is confidential if it is not accessible 
to, or capable of being reconstructed by, unauthorised persons, 
business processes or IT systems.  
Integrity: Information possesses integrity if it has not been 
modified or destroyed by any unauthorised means. An information-
processing system (IT system) possesses integrity if it can perform 
its intended functions without hindrance and free of unauthorised 
manipulations, whether deliberate or accidental. 
Traceability: Actions and technologies applied to information 
are traceable if they themselves and their source can be traced back 
without any ambiguity. 
Availability: Information is available if it is always capable of 
being used to a predefined extent by authorised persons, business 
processes and IT systems when it is required. 
Commerzbank attaches great importance to the protection and 
security of its own information, of that entrusted to it by customers, 
and of the business processes and IT products used to process it. 
They form a permanent core element in our IT strategy. IT security 
requirements are based on the IT security objectives referred to 
above and are set down in policies and procedural instructions. 
IT risks are identified, evaluated and regularly reviewed as part 
of IT governance processes. IT risk is covered in the quarterly IT 
risk report. Information security is also established as a principal 
objective for our Internal Control System. As a result of altered 
conditions, more attention has been given to consideration of the 
four IT security objectives for home office technologies.  
Relevant IT risks are also evaluated as part of operational risk 
management through risk scenarios and considered in the Bank’s 
ErC calculation. This includes the risk of a breakdown of critical IT, 
the risk of external attack on the Bank’s systems or data and the 
risks of cloud sourcing (cyber risk and cloud scenarios), the theft of 
corporate data or the default of service providers and vendors. See 
also the description of cyber risk. 
Given the major importance of IT security to Commerzbank, it is 
further developed and improved on an ongoing basis by means of 
strategic initiatives. We have taken into account the significance of 
the “human” factor in IT security and cyber security by introducing 
additional training and awareness-raising measures 
The “IT Strategy 2024–2027” deals with the issues of IT risk 
management and IT security in general and with reference to the 
regulatory requirements of BaFin’s Supervisory Requirements for 
IT in Financial Institutions (BAIT) and of MaRisk. IT security is one 
of the five goals of the IT strategy. In the IT Strategy 2024-2027, 
fields of activity and measures are derived from the status quo. With 
regard to cybersecurity, the Bank will be striving on an ongoing 
basis to optimise the zero trust model and the general application 
of zero trust principles. The associated measures and the measures 
derived from the Information Security Strategy contribute to IT risk 
management. 
Human resources risk 
The internal, management-oriented interpretation of this definition 
at Commerzbank AG includes the following elements in human 
resources risk. 
Adjustment risk: Adjustment risk results when organisational 
and operational circumstances change (for example, restructuring, 
changes in management culture, qualification needs), these 
changes impact employees’ scope of responsibilities and therefore 
require a greater willingness to change on the part of the staff.  
Motivation risk: Motivation risk arises when demotivating 
factors are not eliminated and employees do not adequately 
perceive motivating factors such as management or remuneration. 
The effects (such as withheld performance by employees) can have 
a direct impact on the working environment and the organisation’s 
productivity. 
Departure risk: Departure risk takes into account the conse-
quences of undesired employee departures (for example, if an 
employee resigns voluntarily), particularly when high performers 
are involved. 
Supply risk: Supply risk reflects the consequences of insufficient 
staffing (for example, positions budgeted for but unfilled, 
inadequate development of young staff) and the resulting con-
sequences (operating bottlenecks, increased workload, lower 
productivity and illness).

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Strategy and organisation 
Employees are a key resource for Commerzbank. With this in mind, 
all managers have a basic responsibility to keep an eye on the 
human resources risk within their own area of responsibility and to 
deal with any undesirable developments, if necessary with the 
involvement of Group Human Resources (GM-HR). Human 
resources risk is additionally and systematically managed by GM-
HR with the aim of identifying, assessing and managing any 
changes in the risk situation, such as through the use of selected 
personnel tools.  
The Group division GM-HR is the responsibility of the Group 
Human Resources division head, who reports directly to the 
member of the Board of Managing Directors responsible for human 
resources (CHRO). 
Risk management 
The strategic guidelines from the overarching Group risk strategy 
apply without limitation to human resources risk. The operational 
risk sub-risk strategy, as part of the overall risk strategy of 
Commerzbank, sets the risk strategy framework and contains a 
detailed description of human resources risk management in 
addition to strategic and organisational elements. In this context, 
GM-HR prepares a human resources risk report for Commerzbank 
AG and its largest subsidiaries every six months for the attention of 
the Board of Managing Directors in order to assess adjustment risk, 
motivation risk, departure risk and supply risk based on defined 
criteria and to identify current risk-relevant areas where action is 
needed. 
Adjustment risk is countered through selected internal and 
external training, continuing education and change measures. 
Steps are taken to ensure that the qualification levels of our 
employees keep pace with the current requirements, that guidance 
is provided for structural changes and that our employees can fulfil 
their duties and responsibilities. The potential for a loss of expertise 
is countered with training aimed at reskilling and upskilling as well 
as the elaboration of a sustainable human resources development 
plan. 
Motivation risk is captured by GM-HR by means of regular 
employee surveys. These enable us to respond swiftly to potential 
changes in employees’ level of corporate loyalty and to initiate 
adequate measures. This includes the development of incentive 
systems to recognise individual achievements as well as measures 
for employee development and the reassignment of more 
demanding tasks to top performers. 
With regard to departure risk, great care is taken to avoid lasting 
disruptions to operational processes caused by the absence or 
departure of employees. GM-HR monitors staff turnover on a 
regular basis from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. 
Another risk-mitigating measure is agreement on mutual consent 
for social plan instruments to prevent unwanted departures in the 
context of downsizing measures. 
Supply risk is countered by appropriate staffing in quantitative 
and qualitative terms. The aim in this is to ensure that the internal 
operating requirements, business activities and prevailing strategy 
of Commerzbank AG can be implemented. In addition to 
strengthening the employer brand, this also includes modernising 
the recruitment process in Germany and at international locations. 
These steps can help ensure that an appropriate number of 
employees with the required qualifications are available. 
Current developments 
In order to ensure the necessary stability in human resources and 
to 
manage 
transformation-related 
human 
resources 
risks 
appropriately, a variety of measures were taken to support the 
“Strategy 2024” programme. Overall, the human resources risk 
situation must continue to be monitored as it may shift in response 
to structural changes (for example, as a result of a revised Group 
strategy). In view of demographic change and extremely com-
petitive employee profiles, increasing demands can be expected 
both in terms of retaining and recruiting new employees. These 
human resources risks are being countered through change and 
organisational measures that have already been introduced as well 
as through Commerzbank AG’s new employer campaign in 
particular.  
Outsourcing risk 
Outsourcing arrangements are defined at Commerzbank in 
accordance with the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements 
(EBA/GL/2019/02) and in line with Art. 25 a/b of the German 
Banking Act (KWG) and MaRisk AT9. The Group Outsourcing Policy 
is the basic framework used by the Group in its efforts to mitigate 
the risks from outsourcing in accordance with the outsourcing 
strategy. The principles and rules for all components of the Group 
Outsourcing Policy are binding on Commerzbank AG and its 
domestic and foreign subsidiaries and branches.  
An essential part of the outsourcing process is determining the 
materiality of the outsourcing project. The classification of each 
outsourcing arrangement as “material” or “non-material” complies 
with regulatory requirements based on a structured risk analysis. 
Material outsourcing arrangements are subject to a more stringent 
control and monitoring system. The responsible first line of defence 
(Retained Organisation) must establish suitable control measures 
for every outsourcing arrangement, such as the checking of service 
quality, satisfaction with the service provider and regular evaluation 
of internal or external audits. In addition, the risk analyses must be 
reviewed and updated on a regular basis. For a material outsourcing 
arrangement, this must be carried out annually; for a non-material 
outsourcing arrangement, the review is carried out in a one, two or 
three-year cycle, depending on the individual risk. Regardless of

this, the first line of defence must update the risk analysis outside 
the control cycle in the event of significant, unforeseen events.  
Outsourcing relationships represent a subset of third-party 
relationships. Increasing complexity, from traditional arrangements 
to cloud outsourcing, requires a correspondingly comprehensive 
approach to supplier and outsourcing risk. Therefore, a holistic 
approach to managing risk across all types of third-party risk will 
be introduced in 2024. 
Supplier risk 
The key points for supplier risk are the assessment and manage-
ment of risks that arise from the relationship with suppliers. 
Supplier risk is already assessed as part of the structured selection 
process for suppliers, covering criteria such as performance and 
profitability.  
In active relationships with suppliers, changes in supplier risk 
are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, risk mitigation measures 
are initiated. Efforts to optimise supplier risk using a risk-oriented 
approach will continue. A holistic approach to managing risk across 
all types of third-party risk will be introduced (see Outsourcing risk) 
in 2024.  
Tax risk 
Tax risk consists of the following components: the risk of submitting 
erroneous1, incomplete or late tax returns, internally calculated tax 
 
1 In the case of errors, it must be determined whether it was possible to 
evaluate/recognise the error as such at the time the tax return or notification was 
submitted. If legal regulations have been undeniably misinterpreted, incorrect 
information has been deliberately provided or existing procedures have not been 
followed, this must be viewed as erroneous. If there is a justifiable different 
interpretation of a legal regulation that leads to an adjustment as part of a tax audit, 
this is not construed as an error within the meaning of operational risk.  
 
returns and mandatory notifications of tax-relevant details/ 
information, or infringement against disclosure, reporting, notify-
cation or cooperation obligations.  
This may result in the following costs: penalties for late 
execution and late payment surcharges due to non-compliance with 
statutory deadlines, interest expenses for back taxes and penalties 
in the form of coercive penalty payments or late payment 
surcharges for non-adherence to cooperation, documentation, 
archiving and retention periods (Principles for the proper keeping 
and storage of books, records and documents in electronic form and 
for data access; GoBD). 
Tax risk also includes: fines or penalty interest arising from 
administrative and criminal tax offences, additional charges due to 
avoidable double taxation (e.g. including the same information in 
different tax contexts), avoidable tax/interest expenses or non-
refund of taxes due to non-filing or improper filing of applications 
or examination of tax assessments, and additional expenses due to 
tax estimates.  
In view of the above-mentioned tax risks and the zero tolerance 
approach to criminal tax offences and to aiding and abetting 
criminal and administrative tax offences, Commerzbank has set up 
a Tax Compliance Management System (TCMS), which is con-
tinually analysed and optimised by the specialised GM-TAX Tax 
Compliance Management unit in collaboration with various units 
inside and outside GM-TAX.  
Commerzbank reports known tax risks resulting from criminal 
tax offences quarterly to the Bank-wide Anti-Fraud & Corruption 
Committee (BAFCC) for Commerzbank AG including material 
foreign branches and relevant subsidiaries.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
The risks listed below are – with the exception of ESG risks - the 
other material risks included in Commerzbank’s risk inventory. ESG 
risk is classified as a “horizontal risk”. 
Compliance risk 
Compliance risk falls within the definition of operational risk. 
Commerzbank acknowledges and understands the existence of 
inherent compliance risk in its areas of business, which are subject 
to the risk of abuse in general and in particular by financial crime. 
Compliance risk in this context comprises risks relating to money 
laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions/embargoes, markets 
compliance, other punishable actions such as fraud, bribery and 
corruption, as well as consideration of human rights and environ-
mental risks in accordance with the German Supply Chain Due 
Diligence Act (LkSG). 
In order to actively promote a compliance culture in the Bank, 
the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank has laid down 
and communicated corresponding values in the Code of Conduct. 
Organisation 
Group Compliance is led by the Divisional Board member for Group 
Compliance, who reports directly to the Board of Managing 
Directors. Pursuant to Art. 87 (5) of the German Securities Trading 
Act (WpHG) and BT 1.1 MaComp (minimum requirements of the 
compliance function), the Group Compliance division head is both 
the Group’s Compliance Officer and, under Art. 25 h (7) of the 
German Banking Act (KWG) and Art. 7 and 9 of the German Anti-
Money Laundering Act (GwG), the Anti-Money Laundering Officer, 
or Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer for the Group. The Group 
Compliance division head also assumes the role as human rights 
officer according to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act 
(LkSG).  
Group Compliance is responsible for: 
A. The five types/areas of compliance risk:  
1) anti money laundering / fighting terrorist financing  
2) sanctions and embargoes  
3) combating fraud, bribery and corruption  
4) markets compliance  
5) consideration of human rights and environmental risks in 
accordance with the LkSG 
as well as  
B. Further responsibilities:  
1) coordination of the requirements under MaRisk section 4.4.2 
(“MaRisk compliance function”),  
2) independent implementation of internal special investigations 
with compliance relevance. 
Risk management 
To prevent compliance risks, Commerzbank has implemented secu-
rity systems and controls for its transactions, customers, products 
and processes. These procedures for ensuring compliance with ma-
terial legal provisions and requirements are referred to in their en-
tirety as a compliance management system. Commerzbank’s com-
pliance management system is based on international market 
standards and the regulatory requirements in the various countries 
which are relevant for Commerzbank’s business activities. Commerz-
bank is constantly developing its compliance management system 
in order to meet its responsibilities and address the growing com-
plexity and increasing regulatory requirements. Under the three 
lines of defence principle, protecting against undesirable compli-
ance risks is an activity that is not restricted to the compliance func-
tion (Group Compliance). Instead, the organisational control and 
monitoring elements are aligned in three sequential levels. The 
units in the first line of defence (1st LoD) assume responsibility as 
part of their operational activities for identifying and managing risks 
and for complying with their own business rules; they are also re-
sponsible for setting up process-oriented control mechanisms. 
Group Compliance, the second line of defence (2nd LoD), sets 
standards for appropriate risk management, oversees the appropri-
ateness and effectiveness of the procedures and controls in the first 
line of defence, and assesses and communicates any deficiencies 
found. In addition, Group Compliance carries out analyses and as-
sessments of compliance risks and ensures that the risk manage-
ment framework is implemented. Internal Audit, the third line of de-
fence (3rd LoD), uses regular and independent audits to check that 
compliance in both the 1st LoD and 2nd LoD is appropriate and ef-
fective. 
Compliance risks are managed in a control circuit with interact-
ing elements. Commerzbank constantly monitors relevant regula-
tory requirements and ensures the definition or adjustment of cor-
responding internal standards intended to make sure it complies 
with the requirements. Regular internal training measures and con-
sulting services from the compliance function support the effective 
implementation of these standards in the Group. Implementation 
encompasses setting up and carrying out suitable processes and 
controls in daily work, assuring their quality and testing their effec-
tiveness in the 1st and 2nd LoD. Compliance risks are monitored 
and are the subject of regular internal reporting. Where necessary, 
matters are escalated according to their urgency and severity.

Risk analysis (compliance risk analysis) is one of the core ele-
ments of risk management. It assesses the inherent risk arising from 
doing business with different customer groups and products and 
compares this in the Control Assessment with an evaluation of the 
corresponding control environment for mitigating the inherent risk. 
A residual risk is determined as the outcome. The Bank defines 
measures to further enhance risk management (e.g. introducing ad-
ditional controls) as necessary and tracks implementation closely.  
The compliance sub-risk strategy, as part of the overall risk 
strategy of Commerzbank, sets the risk strategy framework for 
dealing with compliance risks and contains a detailed description of 
compliance risk management in addition to strategic and 
organisational elements. In particular, the risk appetite per 
compliance risk type is specified and the strategic fields of action 
are defined. Group Compliance factors the Bank’s Strategy 2027 
into the sub-risk strategy.  
Current developments 
Overall, there continues to be an increased focus on ensuring the 
implementation of sanctions requirements and the prosecution of 
possible sanction violations.  
Political and regulatory attention remains firmly fixed on Russia-
related sanctions, as shown in particular by the 12th EU sanctions 
package of 18 December 2023 and US Executive Order 14114, 
which was also enacted in December 2023. Current geopolitical 
developments, as well as the evolving expectations of regulators 
with regard to the implementation of sanctions requirements, are 
continuously monitored in order to be able to react promptly to 
changes.  
Recently, export control requirements in particular have become 
a focal point with respect to achieving the objectives of the sanctions. 
Regulators have now defined various individual goods and classes of 
goods that are not allowed to be exported to Russia. These 
restrictions on trade in goods are widespread and cover a large 
number of goods – far beyond armaments or dual-use goods that 
were previously the focus of attention. Accordingly, Commerzbank 
has established enhanced screening routines, particularly in the 
trade finance business, in order to fulfil the requirements. In addition, 
emphasis is placed on detecting possible transactions aimed at 
evading sanctions.  
In January 2024, in the context of the EU trilogue negotiations, 
an agreement was reached on uniform standards for combating 
money laundering and terrorist financing in all EU member states. 
The new EU AML regulation will have an impact on all of 
Commerzbank’s business segments. Group Compliance is currently 
analysing the requirements and helping the impacted areas of the 
Bank make the necessary adjustments to processes and controls.  
The level of external fraud-related attacks increased significantly 
in 2023. The level of attacks is expected to continue to rise, 
particularly through “fraud as a service” in which fraudsters make 
use of generative artificial intelligence. Group Compliance will there-
fore continue to focus on fraud prevention in 2024. 
The compliance risks in connection with the plans for crypto 
custody services for corporate clients may in principle affect all 
compliance risk types; AML and sanctions risks as well as market 
compliance risks (because of the Markets in Crypto-assets 
Regulation (MiCAR)) are of particular importance.  
Reputational risk 
Reputational risk is the risk that stakeholders may lose confidence 
in Commerzbank or that its reputation may be damaged as a result 
of negative events in its business activities. Commerzbank’s 
stakeholder groups include in particular the public and the media, 
non-governmental organisations and its customers. In the present-
day competitive environment, a company’s reputation is becoming 
more and more important. The main factor determining this is how 
companies handle environmental or social risks in their core 
business (intrinsic reputational risks). Companies are judged not 
only on the basis of people’s personal experiences of them, but also 
on reports reaching the public, especially through the media. 
Reputational risk therefore goes hand in hand with communication 
risk. 
Strategy and organisation 
All employees and managers have a fundamental duty to protect 
and reinforce Commerzbank’s good reputation as a significant 
element of its enterprise value. The segments and significant 
subsidiaries bear direct responsibility for reputational risk resulting 
from their particular business activity. Managing intrinsic 
reputational risk means in particular identifying and reacting to 
potential environmental and social risks at an early stage, thereby 
reducing any potential communication risk or even preventing it 
completely. 
The Reputational Risk Management department is part of the 
central Group Communications division of the Commerzbank Group 
and focuses on intrinsic reputational risk that may directly lead to 
reputational damage among stakeholder groups. The department 
maintains close links with the relevant front office units. 
Management of intrinsic reputational risk is the responsibility of the 
Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors. It is a component of 
Commerzbank’s overall risk strategy. Reputational Risk Manage-
ment’s tasks include identifying, evaluating and addressing intrinsic 
reputational risk in systematic processes at an early stage and 
suggesting or implementing appropriate measures (early warning 
function). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
258 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
According to the risk inventory, reputational risk is one of the 
main non-quantifiable risk types in the Commerzbank Group. These 
must be limited and monitored in accordance with the overall risk 
strategy through a sub-risk strategy using suitable qualitative 
guidelines. Thus, the reputational risk management sub-risk 
strategy gives specific shape to the overall risk strategy through 
strategic management that is based on three main pillars: 
• Firstly, strategic management of the intrinsic reputational risk 
aims to prevent reputational damage from arising from socially 
or environmentally questionable transactions, products and 
customer relationships. To this end, Commerzbank has created 
the clear governance structures described in this sub-risk 
strategy. 
• Secondly, expected economic implications of reputational 
damage (lower business volumes) are factored directly into 
business planning and multi-year planning.  
• Thirdly, the risk-bearing capacity analysis implicitly takes into 
account possible effects of reputational risks materialising 
unexpectedly in business risk or operational risk.  
 
The global functional lead for managing intrinsic reputational 
risk in the Commerzbank Group lies with Group Communications/ 
Public Affairs/Reputational Risk Management. 
 
The strategy aims to ensure  
• overall management of intrinsic reputational risk, as well as: 
– the consideration of environmental risk aspects considered 
material (currently greenwashing), 
– an annual scenario analysis on aspects of environmental risk 
relevant to reputational risk (climate-related and biodiversity 
risks), 
• explicit integration of sustainability criteria into banking 
business, 
• internal measures to raise the awareness of managers and 
employees for intrinsic reputational risk and the associated 
corporate responsibility,  
• informing management through reputational risk reporting. 
Management 
Intrinsic reputational risks are essentially managed by the 
Reputational Risk Management department using a qualitative 
approach. As part of a structured process, transactions, products 
and customer relationships in connection with sensitive areas are 
assessed with reference to environmental and social risks on a 
qualitative five-point scale. This assessment can contain conditions 
and in some cases a negative verdict, which could lead to a rejection. 
In addition to the qualitative assessment of intrinsic reputational 
risks, an annual scenario-based ICAAP materiality analysis is used 
to quantitatively assess the impact of environmental risks 
(particularly climate-related and biodiversity risks) on reputational 
risks and to ensure appropriate ICAAP consideration via business 
risk.  
The sensitive areas regularly and comprehensively analysed in 
Reputational Risk Management include armaments exports, and 
transactions and customer relationships relating to power 
generation and commodities extraction. Commerzbank’s attitude 
towards these areas is laid down in positions, guidelines and the 
ESG framework that are binding for all employees. Commerzbank’s 
Reputational Risk Management department regularly observes and 
analyses new environmental and social issues and informs the 
relevant parts of the Bank about these, if necessary. The 
reputational risks identified and addressed by the department are 
incorporated into the quarterly reputational risk report – part 1: 
non-quantifiable risks; part 2: high and major intrinsic reputational 
risks (sustainability issues) – which is prepared for the Board of 
Managing Directors and the Risk Committee of the Supervisory 
Board. 
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
risks 
The integration of ESG aspects into the Bank’s risk management 
processes is hugely important for sustainable finance. Under the 
three lines of defence approach, ESG risks are viewed as a 
horizontal type of risk and are therefore managed across various 
control units at the Bank. Group Sustainability Management also 
acts the second line of defence for social (S) and governance (G) 
risks, serving as a central point of oversight. For environmental risks 
(E), this is the responsibility of the Chief Environmental Risk Officer 
(CERO) and the Environmental Risk Control operating unit within 
the risk control function. 
Through our ESG framework we have made our understanding of 
and commitment to sustainability transparent for all stakeholders. 
The framework creates a Bank-wide standard that enables stringent 
management of all relevant products, processes and activities and 
ensures the sustainable transformation of Commerzbank. The focus 
of the ESG framework is on our core business. We distinguish 
between “transformation finance” and “sustainable finance”. We are 
convinced that the entire economy has a role to play in sustainable 
transformation and must act accordingly. Therefore, we classify all 
portfolio components that are not affected by our exclusion criteria 
as transformation finance. Sustainable finance, on the other hand, 
describes that part of our portfolio that we classify as explicitly 
sustainable. This includes financial products and services that serve 
positive environmental and/or social purposes and thus contribute, 
for example, to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement or the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals. In order to determine which 
exposures meet our sustainability requirements and are thus part of 
sustainable finance, we have developed a transparent review system 
and our own criteria, which are disclosed in the ESG framework.

The ESG framework also provides an overview of our sustainability 
directives and exclusion criteria.  
We are pursuing the strategic goal of reducing the CO2 emissions 
of our entire loan and investment portfolio to net zero by 2050. To 
this end, we analysed the carbon intensity of Commerzbank’s entire 
portfolio in 2022 using sector-specific target values in accordance 
with the Paris Agreement. In terms of methodology, we are guided 
by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), which advocates the 
reduction of greenhouse gases on the basis of scientifically 
calculated targets. This enables companies to align their climate 
policy with the goals of the Paris Agreement and effectively 
counteract climate change. Using the SBTi method “Sectoral 
Decarbonisation Approach” (SDA), we have set specific sector-
specific goals with a view to reducing the CO2 emissions associated 
with our loan and investment portfolio (known as “financed 
emissions”) and ultimately meeting our net zero target. 
We aim to manage all portfolios highlighted as requiring 
attention in the SBTi method, with a particular focus on emissions-
intensive sectors. These include power generation, automotive 
manufacturing, and the production of cement, iron and steel. We 
will likewise consider the private residential mortgage loan portfolio, 
which is deemed optional in the SBTi analysis. In 2022, 
corresponding 
emissions 
intensity 
reduction 
targets 
were 
formulated for all these portfolios and they were validated under the 
SBTi at the beginning of 2023. The portfolio targets under the SBTi 
are published in the ESG framework. The status of target 
achievement is regularly updated in this framework. Our ambition 
is to support companies in the real economy in their transition 
process and to sustainably reduce emissions. 
Commerzbank defines environmental risks as both climate-
related and biodiversity risks. We do not see environmental risk as 
a separate type of risk, but as a horizontal risk that can materialise 
in the familiar types of risk. In 2023, we carried out another 
comprehensive materiality analysis for environmental risks across 
all risk types for the Commerzbank Group as part of the annual risk 
inventory process, taking into account the requirements of the 
European 
Central 
Bank’s 
“Guide 
on 
climate-related 
and 
environmental risks”.  
 
1 Transition risks arise for companies as a result of the transition to a lower-emission and 
more sustainable economic system (e.g. owing to regulatory or legal changes in energy 
policy, changes in market sentiment and preferences or technological innovations). 
Physical risks arise as a result of changing climatic conditions and the associated more 
extreme and more frequent acute weather events, such as floods or heatwaves, or 
chronic effects, such as rising sea levels. 
 
As a result of the analysis, the influence of climate-related risks 
for the risk types credit risk, market risk, operational risk (including 
compliance and cyber risk), reputational risk and business risk was 
confirmed as material. No materiality was established for property 
value risks, liquidity risks and model risks. A risk type is considered 
to be materially influenced by climate-related risks as soon as it is 
materially affected by either climate-related transition or physical 
climate-related risks1 in the short, medium or long term. 
Commerzbank considers both climate-related and biodiversity 
risks. These are also regarded as horizontal risks for the Bank. As 
with climate-related risks, the classification of biodiversity risk for 
material risk types is a central component of the annual materiality 
analysis.  
Following the initial 2022 report, the scope of the analyses and 
methodology were expanded to cover more specific issues and 
improved in the reporting year. To summarise, credit risk, 
reputational risk and business risk are materially affected by 
biodiversity risks. The focus here is primarily on medium and long-
term transition risks. The impact analysis enabled us to identify 
potential fields of action and strategic priorities and we plan to 
develop further analyses, measures and products to protect 
biodiversity.  
The findings of the materiality analysis feed into business 
strategy, the overall risk strategy and the sub-risk strategies as well 
as into other core elements of the Bank’s internal process to ensure 
an adequate capital position, such as the internal stress test 
framework and the risk-bearing capacity concept. Particularly in the 
case of risk types materially affected by climate-related risks, 
environmental risks are managed within the risk function 
responsible for the respective risk type. The materiality analysis for 
environmental risks is an integral part of the Commerzbank Group’s 
risk governance. In addition to the annual materiality analysis, we 
carry out internal climate stress tests too.  
Greenwashing risks are also permanently monitored by 
Commerzbank and largely mitigated through various measures. 
These include, for example, greenwashing risk governance such as 
an internal control framework and the consideration of 
greenwashing in the new product process.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
For credit risk, we took a portfolio-specific approach in the 
materiality analysis with regard to climate risk and carried out 
quantitative analyses wherever possible. For the potentially hardest-
hit portfolio (corporate clients), these analyses were carried out 
using a scenario simulation that translates the relevant parameters 
of a scenario into economic effects (changes in balance sheet ratios). 
With regard to transition risks, changes in regulation, price changes, 
shifts in supply and demand and the impact of technological 
changes are considered. In the case of physical risks, effects from 
all relevant events (storm/hurricane, drought, heatwaves, flood, 
rising sea levels) are taken into account.  
As a major financier of the German economy, we are also active 
in sectors that are particularly exposed to climate-related physical 
or transition risks. However, we have little exposure to some of the 
hardest-hit sectors (agriculture, for example). Sectors that could 
potentially be more heavily affected by climate-related risks and 
that have a larger exposure are, for example, the energy sector, the 
automotive sector and mechanical engineering, as well as 
(commercial) real estate finance. Owing to the geographical focus 
of our portfolio in Germany and Europe, we are less affected by 
physical climate risks, such as hurricanes and rising sea levels, than 
other regions in the world. Overall, both climate-related transition 
and physical risks are considered material to credit risk over a long-
term time horizon. 
In order to manage the effects of climate-related risks in 
Commerzbank’s lending business, we combine the specific findings 
from the scenario analyses (including the sector or country-specific 
impact of climate-related risks) with individual risk analysis at 
customer level. The findings from the scenario and credit risk 
analyses are aggregated in a structured assessment (“score”). We 
factor this score into the individual loan decision. Depending on the 
score, increased requirements or restrictions are triggered on a 
portfolio-specific basis. We also use this score as part of our 
portfolio analysis and management. Portfolio-specific guidelines, 
which are anchored in the credit risk strategy, limit the share of the 
portfolio with heightened climate-related risk. In the particularly 
relevant portfolios such as corporate clients, special financing, 
banks and commercial real estate finance, we have supplemented 
the qualitative risk analysis in the individual loan decisions with 
these specific aspects for the analysis of climate-related risks. We 
will progressively extend this approach to other relevant portfolios 
and include smaller companies, for example. In our target state, we 
want to integrate climate risks – as far as possible – into the 
quantitative credit risk analysis and thus fully reflect them across 
the process chain, including in pricing and reporting. 
Another key aspect is the ongoing addition to our specialists’ 
expertise in climate-related risk, which enables us to discuss the 
challenges and assess the risks with our customers on an equal 
footing. By combining these measures, we ensure that we are taking 
appropriate account of the associated risks in our efforts to support 
the transformation. 
Market risk in relation to climate change risk was assessed on a 
portfolio basis and in particular from an economic perspective. 
Overall, Commerzbank is subject to market risks in sectors that are 
potentially affected by climate-related risks and that are sensitive in 
particular to credit spreads in affected sectors, as well as to interest 
rates; all of these risks are likely to increase depending on the 
adaptability of companies and of the world’s economies. It can be 
inferred from the volatility assumptions specific to the climate 
scenario that climate-related transition risk is a material driver of 
market risk in the long term. For physical climate risk, no material 
effects were derived from the scenario calculation. The positions 
particularly affected by climate risks are subject to regular 
monitoring. 
Operational risk has also been classified with regard to 
environmental risks in the defined time horizons. Specific scenario 
analyses were used to quantify possible effects. As a result, climate-
related transition risks were classified as material in all three time 
horizons. The applied analysis method covered issues including 
natural disasters, supplier or vendor failure, vandalism/terrorism 
(by activists) and greenwashing. The latter scenario in particular is 
a key driver of the materiality classification. Corresponding 
scenarios are factored into the specific modelling for OpRisk and 
are subject to an annual assessment and update. A risk indicator 
that reflects climate-related losses in operational risk was 
established in 2023. Further associated control measures have been 
implemented, such as the establishment of greenwashing controls 
and the screening of new sustainable products including 
greenwashing checks. 
Reputational risk, which is also assessed as material in relation 
to climate-related risk, is one of the Commerzbank Group’s main 
non-quantifiable risk types according to the risk inventory. Sustain-
ability in the core business is assessed by the Reputational Risk 
Management department at Commerzbank. We do not limit 
ourselves to what is legally required; instead, we consider the 
legitimacy of all transactions. To this end, we have formulated 
sector-specific requirements, for example for mining, energy and 
fossil fuels, including oil and gas. Exclusion criteria were defined 
for particularly critical products, transactions or business relation-
ships. In view of the special risks associated with fossil fuels and 
armaments, the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank has 
passed its own binding directives on these matters that define many 
of the relevant transactions and business relationships in these 
areas as being subject to assessment, and encompass exclusion 
criteria. 
Given the particular importance of sustainability aspects, 
including environmental risks, for the overarching business strategy, 
climate-related risk is deemed a material risk driver for business 
risk, driven by medium- and long-term transition risks. Business 
risk may potentially be affected in particular by secondary effects 
from reputational risk. Potential impacts from climate-related risks 
are taken into account in the buffer that has already been

established for business risk and are subject to a regular review of 
their appropriateness. 
To avoid social and governance risks, Commerzbank’s business 
activities are steered by a robust framework. Our binding code of 
conduct is at the heart of this. Other elements include regular, 
comprehensive training for all employees on compliance issues (e.g. 
corruption, bribery, money laundering), regular employee surveys, 
an intensive dialogue with our customers and other external 
stakeholders such as NGOs (through surveys and established 
advisory boards) and an internally and externally available 
whistleblower system. In addition, the focus of our business 
activities is in the European Union and Germany, meaning that they 
are subject to a wide range of legal standards, for example with 
regard to employee and consumer protection. Social and 
governance issues are already an integral part of the Bank’s risk 
management in many areas. That applies, for example, to the 
management of operational and reputational risk and, in particular, 
to compliance risk.  
We also report in detail on our ESG activities and risks in the 
non-financial report, in our GRI report (sustainability reporting in 
accordance with the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative) 
and in the disclosure report in accordance with the CRR.  
Cyber risk 
Cyber risk comprises risks with direct relevance to security and risks 
that lead to relevance to security (with respect to cyber space). The 
part of cyber space of relevance to Commerzbank is all connected IT 
environments within the Bank and those outside the Bank that lead 
to customers, business partners and service providers. Cyber risk is 
therefore concerned with the digital representation of the Bank’s 
assets (data, information) within cyber space. 
The strategic guidelines from the overarching Group risk strategy, 
the Information Security Strategy and the cyber risk sub-risk strategy 
apply without limitation to cyber risk. In particular, this involves 
expanded identity and access management, the implementation of 
the zero trust model, strengthening cyber resilience and continuing 
to implement extensive awareness measures. 
Commerzbank manages cyber and information security risks via 
the Group division “Group Risk Management – Cyber Risk & 
Information Security” (GRM-CRIS), which reports to the Group 
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). In addition to established 
security functions such as the ISO 27001 certified Information 
Security Management System (ISMS) as well as risk reporting on 
key risk indicators, GRM-CRIS focuses on managing cyber risk 
appropriately and on strengthening Commerzbank’s cyber-resi-
lience (including its information security incident management 
capabilities). It also addresses the interaction between cyber and 
information security risks and other types of material risk relating 
to areas such as operational risk. 
The main factor in the current cyber risk situation – in which risk 
remains at a high level – is the geopolitical tension surrounding the 
Ukraine war. The Russia-Ukraine war continues to harbour a risk of 
attacks by state actors on critical infrastructure and resulting 
collateral effects on the Bank.  
Ransomware has become one of the established attack vectors 
in organised cyber crime, and is a threat in particular to SMEs. With 
regard to distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, we are 
observing an increasing shift from the network to the application 
level.  
Steps have already been initiated to ensure improved protection 
from these threats by means of the agreed packages of capital 
investment and associated measures. Developments in the cyber 
context are observed on an ongoing basis at Commerzbank by an 
interdisciplinary task force (top management and specialists from 
GRM-CRIS and Group Technology Foundations – GS-TF). 
By closely interlinking the first and second line of defence 
activities in the field of cyber threat analysis, including correspond-
ing protective measures and incident management processes, the 
Bank aims to continue to be adequately protected against such 
attacks. 
Business risk 
Business risk is the risk of negative effects on the achievement of 
Commerzbank’s projected results with a one-year risk horizon and 
the Bank’s medium to long-term strategic goals, for example as a 
result of changes in the market or competitive environment, capital 
market requirements, regulatory/political factors or the inadequate 
implementation of the Group strategy (primary risk drivers). 
Strategy and organisation 
On the basis of external and internal factors, the Board of Managing 
Directors sets out a sustainable business strategy describing the 
major business activities and steps required to meet the targets.  
The aim in managing and monitoring ongoing business risk is to 
make a prediction about possible adverse deviations in the develop-
ment of the operating results from the planned figures over a  
12-month time horizon and thus to take the volatility of the under-
lying income and expenses into account when planning business 
activities. The aim of medium to long-term business strategy risk 
management, on the other hand, is the appropriate implementation 
of Group strategy in order to achieve the announced business goals 
and, if necessary, early adjustment of the business strategy if 
changes in the environment become apparent. 
Risk management  
To ensure proper implementation of the Group strategy to achieve 
the business targets, strategic controls are carried out through 
regular monitoring of quantitative and qualitative targets in the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
262 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Group and the segments. The bank has various instruments at its 
disposal to make deviations between actual performance and 
planned performance transparent at an early stage and to initiate 
countermeasures to limit business risk – including regular reporting 
on the earnings situation for the Group and the segments, including 
monitoring KPIs and early warning indicators. Based on ongoing 
observations of the German and international market and 
competitive environment as well as the requirements of the regulator 
and the capital markets, the main changes and developments that 
are visible in the medium to long term are continuously analysed and 
the necessary measures are derived from this to ensure the Bank’s 
long-term success. Strategy implementation is checked and tracked 
on an ongoing basis; this includes in particular regular monitoring 
of progress made with respect to the implementation of the delivery 
portfolio defined for the “Moving forward” strategy. 
From an economic perspective, the management of business risk 
is closely linked to internally defined capital ratio requirements. The 
fulfilment of these requirements and the way in which business risk 
is taken into account when placing a limit on the risk-bearing 
capacity ratio ensure that sufficient capital backing is available at all 
times (risk coverage potential). If it becomes necessary to make 
adjustments to Commerzbank’s risk appetite and/or initiate capital 
measures, this is done in line with general risk governance under the 
overall risk strategy. In the normative perspective, business risk is 
implicitly taken into account through the SREP P2G and P2R 
requirements as well as various scenario formats with a time horizon 
of up to three years. 
Responsibility for strategic corporate management and for 
managing business risk as part of achieving the planned results lies 
with the Board of Managing Directors. Specific business policy 
decisions (acquisition and sale of equity holdings > €300m) also 
require the authorisation of the Supervisory Board’s Risk 
Committee. In addition, all major initiatives and projects are 
decided by the Board of Managing Directors. 
Property value risk 
Property value risk is understood to be the risk that arises from 
• the negative change in market values of Group properties that 
have already been recognised as assets in the next 12 months 
with a corresponding charge to the income statement,  
• properties that may be recognised on the Group’s balance sheet 
owing to contractually guaranteed obligations in the nature of 
options for certain dates and fixed redemption prices for 
investors and accordingly may have a negative impact on the 
income statement. 
 
Property value risk results from real estate used for business 
purposes and from the business activities of Commerz Real. 
Strategy and organisation 
Property value risk is classified as a material risk type for Commerz-
bank and is included as a quantifiable risk in determining the 
economic capital requirement and thus directly in the risk-bearing 
capacity calculation. In the normative perspective of the ICAAP, 
property value risk is taken into account as part of the scenario 
analyses. 
The property value risk resulting from real estate used for 
business purposes includes risk from the market environment, risk 
for business activities and risk from legal proceedings. The need for 
cost-effective provision of adequate premises for the Bank is 
factored into the desired risk structure as a key consideration. The 
multi-year planning for premises costs adopted in each case acts as 
a guide for mapping the financial opportunities and risks within the 
real estate portfolio. Commerz Real’s property value risk results 
from directly held assets, assets from majority equity holdings, 
assets from minority equity holdings and outstanding residual 
values as well as tenant loans from real estate leasing contracts. The 
central asset classes are ships, real estate and infrastructure. 
Sustainably achievable cash flow is the central risk driver.  
Risk management 
When managing and controlling property value risk, a distinction is 
made between two different classes:  
1. 
real estate used for business purposes 
2. 
property value risk at Commerz Real  
For the sake of completeness, the first class also includes prop-
erty-related risks that arise from the perspective of a real estate op-
erator and that go beyond the scope of the property value risk.

The Group value for property value risk is calculated each 
quarter and reported regularly in the Group Risk & Capital Monitor.  
At Group level, property value risk is restricted overall by an 
economic limit, which is set and regularly monitored as part of the 
setting of economic limits under the overall risk strategy. If the limit 
is exceeded, defined escalation mechanisms under the overall risk 
strategy apply. 
Model risk 
Model risk is the risk of incorrect management decisions based upon 
an inaccurate depiction of reality by the models used. With regard to 
the causes of model risk we distinguish between model risk from 
exceeding model boundaries and model risk from model errors 
(manual errors in model development/implementation). In line with 
the focus of the Group risk strategy, namely to ensure that the Bank 
has adequate capital and liquidity, the models for assessing risk-
bearing capacity (capital requirements under the Basel framework 
and economic capital requirements, respectively) and liquidity 
resources are central for risk management. 
Model risk constitutes a material but non-quantifiable type of 
risk. Therefore, a qualitative management approach is applied: The 
basic principles of model risk management are the identification and 
avoidance of model risks and appropriate consideration of known 
model risks (e.g. through conservative calibration or consideration 
of margins of conservatism or model reserves). Model risks that are 
unknown and hence cannot be mitigated are accepted as an inherent 
risk in the complexity of the Commerzbank business model. In 
respect of the governance of model risk management, requirements 
relating to model validation, model development and model changes 
are established. 
The war in the Ukraine and its geopolitical impact as well as the 
economic secondary effects from the coronavirus pandemic pose 
challenges for the risk models used. These factors are taken into 
account in ongoing management of model risks and in particular in 
regular validation work.  
The strategically relevant credit risk models (PD, LGD, CCF for 
private and corporate customers, PD for banks and for renewable 
energy project financing) are currently being fundamentally revised. 
In this context, high standards in model development and initial 
validation play a major role. In addition, a project to consolidate the 
booking systems for financial products will be completed in 2024, 
with implications for the valuation models used for the correspond-
ing products and therefore relevant from a model risk perspective.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Disclaimer 
Commerzbank’s internal risk measurement methods and models 
which form the basis for the calculation of the figures shown in this 
report are state-of-the-art and based on banking sector practice. 
The risk models produce results appropriate to the management of 
the Bank. The measurement approaches are regularly reviewed by 
Risk Controlling and Internal Audit as well as by German and 
European supervisory authorities. Despite being carefully devel-
oped and regularly checked, models cannot cover all the influencing 
factors that have an impact in reality or illustrate their complex 
behaviour and interactions. These limits to risk modelling apply in 
particular in extreme situations. Supplementary stress tests and 
scenario analyses can only show examples of the risks to which a 
portfolio may be exposed in extreme market situations; stress-
testing all imaginable scenarios is not feasible. They cannot 
definitively estimate the maximum loss should an extreme event 
occur.

There was no AT1 bond issuance in the current financial year and

Other changes 
As at 31 December 2023, the subscribed capital of Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft pursuant to the Bank’s Articles of Association 
was €1,240m (previous year: €1,252m) and was divided into 
1,240,223,329 no-par-value shares (previous year: 1,252,357,634 
no-par-value shares) (accounting value per share of €1.00). 
Pursuant to a share buyback programme, 12,134,305 no-par-value 
shares representing 0.97% of the share capital were repurchased 
in June 2023. The average purchase price per share paid on the 
stock market was €10.05. The purpose of the share buyback was to 
reduce the share capital of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. The 
repurchased shares were cancelled on 29 September 2023. Since 
then, the share capital pursuant to the Bank’s Articles of Association 
has amounted to 1,240,223,329 shares. 
A proposal to pay a dividend of €0.35 per share out of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s net profit for the 2023 financial 
year (previous year: dividend of €0.20 per share paid) will be put 
before the AGM. With 1,240,223,329 shares issued as at 
31 December 2023 (previous year: 1,252,357,634), there would 
have been a distribution amount of €434m, without taking account 
of the share buyback programme launched at the beginning of 
January 2024. A dividend of €250m was paid in the previous year. 
As at 31 December 2023, and as in the previous year, there was 
no material impact on “Other reserves” from non-current assets 
held for sale. 
As at 31 December 2023, the portion of inactive hedging 
relationships in the cash flow hedge reserve was €–2m (previous 
year: €–3m), and the portion of active hedging relationships was  
€–50m (previous year: €–114m).  
The main changes in the currency translation reserve in the 
current financial year were due to the US dollar, Polish zloty, British 
pound, Brasilian real and Russian rouble. 
Other changes primarily include changes in the group of 
consolidated companies and changes from taxes not recognised in 
the income statement. 
The changes in ownership interests in retained earnings of €–2m 
(previous year: €–2m) resulted from the purchase of additional 
interests in already consolidated companies.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
General information 
 
 
The Commerzbank Group has its headquarters at Kaiserplatz in 
60311, Frankfurt/Main, Germany. The parent company is 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, which is registered in the 
Commercial Register at the District Court of Frankfurt/Main under 
registration no. HRB 32000. Commerzbank is one of Germany’s 
leading banks for private and corporate clients and an 
internationally active commercial bank. Our Group financial 
statements as at 31 December 2023 were prepared in accordance 
with Art. 315 e of the German Commercial Code (Handels-
gesetzbuch, or “HGB”) and Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 (the IAS 
Regulation). In addition, other regulations for adopting certain 
international accounting standards on the basis of the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) approved and published by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and their 
interpretation by the IFRS Interpretations Committee have also 
been applied. 
All standards and interpretations that are mandatory within the 
EU in the 2023 financial year have been applied. We have not 
applied standards and interpretations that are not required until the 
2024 financial year or later. 
The information required under IFRS 7.31 to 7.42 (nature and 
extent of exposure to risks arising from financial instruments) is 
basically reported in the Group management report, Risk section 
(for further information please refer to notes 33 and 34).  
The Group management report, including the separate Group 
risk report appears on pages 183 to 263 of this Annual Report. 
The Group financial statements are prepared in euros, the 
reporting currency of the Group. Unless otherwise indicated, all 
amounts are shown in millions of euros. All items under 
€500,000.00 are presented as €0.00, and zero items are denoted by 
a dash. Due to rounding, in some cases the individual figures 
presented may not add up precisely to the totals provided. 
For information on environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
risks, we refer to the management report of this Annual Report 
(pages 258 ff.). 
(1) Initially applicable, revised and new standards 
Standards to be applied for the first time 
 
Global minimum taxation 
The Commerzbank Group has applied International Tax Reform – 
Pillar Two Model Rules (amendments to IAS 12) since the it was 
published on 23 May 2023. The amendments contain a mandatory 
temporary exemption, applicable immediately, to the accounting for 
deferred taxes resulting from the introduction of global minimum 
taxation. Furthermore, the amendments provide for targeted 
disclosure requirements enabling an understanding of the extent to 
which the Commerzbank Group is affected by minimum taxation, 
both currently and going forward.  
It is assumed that Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft will be 
subject to minimum taxation because it has subsidiaries and 
business premises in countries that have a nominal tax rate of less 
than 15 percent. However, global minimum taxation is not currently 
expected to give rise to any significant tax burden in any jurisdiction. 
Revised standards 
 
The revision of the IAS 1 and IFRS 16 standards clarifies the 
classification of debt with credit terms as well as sale and leaseback 
transactions. These amendments have no material effects on the 
Group financial statements. The revised standards must be applied 
for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024.  
Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 were published under the title 
“Supplier Finance Arrangement” and concern regulations on 
supplier financing agreements. Endorsement is still pending. The 
revised standards must be applied for financial years beginning on 
or after 1 January 2024. 
The amendment to IAS 21 concerns updates introduced 
regarding how to determine the exchange rate when there is a long-
term lack of exchangeability, which was previously not regulated. 
Endorsement is still pending. The revised standard must be applied 
for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025. 
The Commerzbank Group does not plan to apply in any of the 
above cases early. 
All standard changes not explicitly mentioned do not have a 
significant impact on our Group financial statements at present.

Accounting and measurement policies
(2) Changes in accounting and measurement policies 
 
We have applied the same accounting and measurement policies in 
these Group financial statements as in our Group financial 
statements as at 31 December 2022. The Commerzbank Group 
changed to hedge accounting prospectively according to IFRS 9 as 
at 1 July 2022. Until 30 June 2022, the option for hedge accounting 
in accordance with IAS 39 was applied (see Note 42). 
 
(3) Significant principles and uncertainties in estimates  
Significant principles  
Uniform accounting and measurement methods explained in the 
notes below are used throughout Commerzbank Group in preparing 
the financial statements. 
The Group financial statements are based on the going concern 
principle. Financial assets and liabilities are generally measured at 
amortised cost, unless a different form of measurement is required 
by IFRS standards. In particular, this applies to certain financial 
instruments classified in accordance with IFRS 9.  
Income and expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis; they 
are recognised in the income statement for the period to which they 
are attributable in economic terms. Interest from all contractual 
agreements relating to financial assets or liabilities is reported in 
net interest income on an accrual basis. We have reported negative 
interest separately in net interest income (see Note 9). Dividend 
income is only recognised where a corresponding legal entitlement 
exists. Commission income and expenses are recognised on the 
basis of the accounting treatment of the associated financial 
instruments and on the basis of the nature of the activity. 
Commission income for services which are performed over a given 
period is recognised over the period in which the service is 
performed. Fees associated with the completion of a particular 
service are recognised at the time of completion of the service. 
Performance-related fees are recognised when the performance 
criteria are met. Commission income on trading transactions 
carried out on behalf of customers is reported in net commission 
income.  
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a significant tangible or intangible 
asset are capitalised in the balance sheet, provided that a period of at 
least 12 months is required to prepare the asset for its intended use. 
Assets and liabilities must be posted in the balance sheet as 
gross (not netted). However, in accordance with IAS 32.42, financial 
assets and liabilities relating to the same counterparty are netted 
and shown in the balance sheet on a net basis if there is a legally 
enforceable right to net the amounts and the transactions are 
fulfilled on a net basis or the asset is realised simultaneously with 
the settlement of the liability.  
In addition to the netting of positive and negative fair values 
attributable to derivatives with clearing agreements and any 
variation margins payable on them, this also applies to the netting 
of claims and liabilities in reverse repo and repo transactions with 
central and bilateral counterparties, provided they have the same 
term. 
For fully consolidated companies and holdings in companies 
accounted for using the equity method in the Group financial 
statements we have generally used financial statements prepared as 
at 31 December 2023. As regards companies accounted for using 
the equity method, in some cases we use the most recent audited 
financial statements under national GAAP if the company’s financial 
statements for the current financial year are not yet available at the 
date the Group financial statements are being prepared.  
Where there is an intention to sell the assets and liabilities of 
subsidiaries and companies accounted for using the equity method 
and their sale is highly probable within one year, they are reported 
separately in the relevant balance sheet items and notes (see 
Notes 47) and in the statement of changes in equity in accordance 
with IFRS 5 until transfer of the shares is completed. 
Note 37 contains a breakdown of all balance sheet items into 
short-term and long-term items. The maturities for all financial 
instruments held as liabilities, financial guarantees and irrevocable 
lending commitments with contractual maturity dates are also 
reported in this note. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies and pending spot foreign exchange transactions are 
translated at the spot mid-rate on the reporting date. Realised 
income and expenses are normally translated using the spot rate 
applying on the date of realisation.  
Average exchange rates may also be used to translate income 
and expenses, provided the prices on the reporting date have not 
undergone major fluctuations. Hedged expenses and income are 
translated using the hedging rate. The expenses and income 
resulting from the translation of items in the balance sheet are 
recognised in the net income from financial assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value through profit and loss. 
Non-monetary items are translated using the current rate 
method. Gains and losses on the translation of non-monetary items 
are recognised either in equity or profit or loss depending on the 
way the net gain or loss is recognised. 
Monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements of consolidated subsidiaries and companies accounted 
for using the equity method that report in foreign currency are 
translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date, 
while income and expenses are normally translated at the exchange 
rate on the transaction date. For simplification purposes, a price can 
be used for translation which represents an approximation of the 
exchange rate on the transaction date, for example the average 
 
 
278 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
exchange rate over a given period. All differences arising on 
translation are recognised as a separate component of equity in the 
currency translation reserve. Effects arising from the translation of 
the capital components of subsidiaries included in the consolidation 
of the capital accounts are recognised in equity in the currency 
translation reserve. On the date of the sale or partial sale of 
companies reporting in foreign currency, the translation gains or 
losses are recognised in other net income. Even if an equity holding 
in a foreign currency is reduced without being fully deconsolidated, 
the effect of this partial reduction on the currency translation 
reserve is recognised in profit or loss. 
Uncertainties in estimates  
The Group financial statements include values which are 
determined, as permitted, on the basis of estimates and judgements. 
The estimates and judgements used are based on past experience 
and other factors, such as planning and expectations or forecasts of 
future events that are considered likely as far as we know today. The 
estimates and judgements themselves and the underlying 
estimation methods and judgement factors are reviewed regularly 
and compared with actual results. Nonetheless, the actual outturns 
may differ from the estimates in the instances listed below. 
Estimation uncertainties arise, among other things, in the 
calculation of fair values or the expected cash flows of financial 
instruments and in the creation of loan loss provisions, which may 
occur in particular when determining the top-level adjustment (TLA) 
for secondary effects. For the calculation of loan loss provisions, 
please also refer to the counterparty risk section of the Group risk 
report within the Group management report. As a horizontal risk 
driver, environmental risks can influence various types of risk. 
Greater detail can be found in the environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) risks section of the Group risk report in the Group 
management report. There are also uncertainties surrounding the 
fair value of investment properties, in the accounting of pension 
obligations, and in provisions for tax-related operational risks. 
Pension obligations are measured based on the projected unit 
credit method for defined benefit pension plans. In measuring such 
obligations, assumptions have to be made, in particular regarding 
the discount rate, the long-term rate of increase in pensions, and 
average life expectancy. Changes in the underlying assumptions 
from year to year and divergences from the actual annual effects are 
reported as remeasurements without effect on income in retained 
earnings (see Note 54 on the impact of changes in parameters). 
Provisions for tax-related operational risks are recognised taking 
into account the most current information from the ongoing tax 
audit and case law (see Note 49). 
There are also uncertainties in the recognition of deferred tax 
assets.  
The assumptions and parameters underlying the estimates we 
have made are based on the exercise of appropriate judgement by 
management. This applies in particular to the appropriate selection 
and use of parameters, assumptions and modelling techniques 
when valuing financial instruments for which there are no market 
prices and no comparative parameters observable on the market. 
Where differing valuation models lead to a range of different 
potential valuations, management uses its judgement to determine 
the choice of the model to be used. 
The following items in the financial statements are also subject 
to the judgement of management: 
• the impairment of loans and securities and the recognition of 
provisions for off-balance-sheet lending exposures, in particular 
the analysis of the borrower’s financial situation and the 
determination of the expected cash flows including the 
recognition, level and timing of the realisation of collateral (see 
Note 31); 
• impairment testing of other financial assets such as holdings in 
companies accounted for using the equity method and financial 
instruments held for sale, in particular the choice of criteria used 
to determine whether an asset is impaired (see Note 47);

• Impairment testing of deferred tax assets, in particular 
determining the methodology used for tax planning and to 
assess the probability that the expected future tax results will 
actually occur (see Notes 48 and 49), as well as accounting for 
tax risk positions; the assessment of the availability of tax assets 
is primarily based on the potential future taxable income based 
on our multi-year planning; 
• the recognition of provisions for uncertain liabilities (see 
Note 54); 
• the assessment of legal risks (see Note 56); 
The main estimation uncertainties relate to the provision for 
possible losses on loans and receivables and debt securities (€3.3bn) 
under the Financial assets – Amortised cost balance sheet item 
(€299bn). 
(4) Adjustments in accordance with IAS 8 
In connection with a change in method for valuation allowances 
(provisions) in prior years, there was an additional adjustment in 
accordance with IAS 8.41 of certain off-balance sheet items that do 
not represent financial guarantees within the meaning of IFRS 9. 
The general valuation allowance based on lifetime expected credit 
loss is replaced by the inclusion of these instruments in the IFRS 9 
stage model. As a result of this adjustment, provisions fell by €38m 
and deferred tax assets decreased by €10m as at 1 January 2022. 
Retained earnings, on the other hand, increased by €28m. This had 
no impact on consolidated profit or loss, the statement of 
comprehensive income or the earnings per share. This adjustment 
was already reported in the interim financial information as at 
31 March 2023, in the interim report as at 30 June 2023 and in the 
interim financial information as at 30 September 2023.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Principles of consolidation 
 
All intragroup receivables and liabilities as well as income and 
expenses resulting from transactions between entities consolidated 
in the Group financial statements are eliminated when liabilities and 
income and expenses are consolidated. Any gains or losses realised 
in the Group on intragroup transactions are likewise consolidated 
as part of interim results elimination. The ability of the 
Commerzbank Group to access or use assets and monitor the 
liabilities of subsidiaries including structured entities, associated 
companies and joint ventures can be subject to legal, regulatory and 
contractual restrictions. 
(5) Subsidiaries and business combinations 
 
Subsidiaries are entities which are directly or indirectly controlled 
by Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, because Commerzbank has 
the power to direct the relevant activities of the entity, has exposure, 
or rights, to significant variable returns from its involvement and 
has the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount 
of its returns. When deciding whether or not to consolidate, we 
review a range of factors such as voting rights, the object and 
structure of the company and our ability to exert influence. If voting 
rights are the sole and immediate dominant factor in directing the 
relevant activities, control can be established more in these cases. 
We are nonetheless obliged to investigate whether there are any 
other factors present, such as legal provisions or contractual 
agreements, which prevent Commerzbank from exercising control 
in spite of holding a majority of voting rights. Other factors can also 
lead to control, for example if Commerzbank and the entity stand in 
a principal-agent relationship. In this case, another party with 
decision-making powers acts as agent for Commerzbank, but does 
not control the entity, because it only exercises powers which have 
been delegated by Commerzbank (the principal). Consolidation 
takes place from the time when the Group acquires control of the 
subsidiary. 
As part of the first-time consolidation of capital, we completely 
remeasure the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries irrespective of 
the interest held at the time of acquisition. The assets and liabilities 
then measured at fair value are included in the Group balance sheet 
net of deferred taxes; identified hidden reserves and liabilities are 
accounted for in accordance with the applicable standards in 
subsequent reporting periods. Any difference over net assets on 
remeasurement is recognised as goodwill. Any negative goodwill is 
reported in the income statement. 
Holdings in subsidiaries not consolidated for reasons of 
immateriality and holdings in associated companies and joint 
ventures which, because of their immateriality, are not accounted 
for using the equity method, are shown at their fair value under 
financial assets in the Mandatorily Fair Value P&L category. 
Subsidiaries are deconsolidated as at the date on which the Bank 
loses its control over them. 
(6) Associated companies and joint ventures 
 
Associated companies are entities over which Commerzbank  
Aktiengesellschaft has a significant direct or indirect influence, but 
does not control. A significant influence is assumed to exist where 
the share of voting rights is between 20% and 50%. Further factors 
indicating significant influence could, for example, be membership 
of an executive or Supervisory Board or significant transactions 
with the company. 
A joint arrangement is where two or more parties agree 
contractually to exercise joint control over this arrangement. A joint 
arrangement can be a joint venture or a joint operation. In the 
Commerzbank Group there are only joint ventures.  
Associated companies and joint ventures are ordinarily 
accounted for using the equity method and are reported in the 
balance sheet under holdings in companies accounted for using the 
equity method.  
The acquisition cost of these investments including goodwill is 
determined at the time of their initial consolidation, applying by 
analogy the same rules as for subsidiaries. If associated companies 
and joint ventures are material, appropriate adjustments are made 
to the carrying value in the accounts, in accordance with 
developments in the company’s equity. Losses attributable to 
companies accounted for using the equity method are only 
recognised up to the level of the carrying value (see Note 43). 
Losses in excess of this amount are not recognised, since there is 
no obligation to offset excess losses. Future profits are first offset 
against unrecognised losses. 
Equity accounting for holdings in associated companies ends on 
the date that the Group ceases to exert significant influence over 
the associated company. Equity accounting for joint ventures ends 
on the date that joint control of the venture comes to an end.

(7) Structured entities 
 
Structured entities are entities where voting or similar rights are not 
the dominant factor in determining control, such as when the voting 
rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities 
are directed by means of contractual arrangements. Examples of 
structured entities are securitisation companies, leasing structured 
entities and some investment funds. 
Commerzbank also acts as sponsor to structured entities in 
which it does not have an equity holding. A company is considered 
to be sponsored if it was founded and/or structured by  
Commerzbank Group, received or purchased assets from the 
Commerzbank Group, was granted guarantees by Commerzbank 
Group, or has been intensively marketed by Commerzbank Group. 
As with subsidiaries, a structured entity must be consolidated if 
Commerzbank exerts control over it. In the Commerzbank Group 
the obligation to consolidate structured entities is reviewed by 
means of a process that includes transactions where Commerzbank 
launches a structured entity with or without the involvement of third 
parties, and transactions where Commerzbank enters into a 
contractual relationship with an already existing structured entity 
with or without the involvement of third parties. Decisions as to 
whether or not to consolidate an entity are reviewed as the need 
arises, but no less than once a year. All consolidated structured 
entities and structured entities that have not been consolidated for 
materiality reasons are listed in Note 69. 
 
(8) Consolidated companies 
 
The Group financial statements include all material subsidiaries 
which are directly or indirectly controlled by Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft. These also include material structured entities. 
Significant associated companies and joint ventures are accounted 
for using the equity method.  
Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures of minor 
significance for the Group’s assets, liabilities financial position and 
financial performance are not fully consolidated or not accounted 
for using the equity method; instead, they are measured at fair value 
and reported under “Financial assets – Mandatorily fair value P&L”.  
Please refer to Note 69 for more information on the structure of 
Commerzbank Group including a full list of the Group’s ownership 
interests. 
Deconsolidation of  Banco Múltiplo, Brasilien  
 
In the second quarter of 2023, the Commerzbank Brasil S.A. – 
Banco Múltiplo, Brazil subsidiary was deconsolidated due to 
immateriality. Its banking licence was surrendered in April 2023. 
The deconsolidation resulted in an effect of €–24m, which is 
recognised in Other net income. 
Changes in the previous financial year  
Disposal Commerzbank ZRT 
 
The sale of Commerzbank Zrt., Budapest, a wholly-owned 
Hungarian subsidiary, to Erste Group Hungary Zrt. was completed 
during the fourth quarter of 2022, following approval by the banking 
supervisory and antitrust authorities. The sale resulted in a negative 
effect of €–49m in other net income. This loss relates to the 
Corporate Clients segment and results in particular from the 
reversal of the negative foreign currency reserve.

(9) Net interest income 
 
All interest income and interest expenses – including interest-
related income and expenses – are reported in this item, provided 
they do not result from the held-for-trading portfolio. 
Interest income includes all income that is generated from the 
primary bank business or banking-related transactions. This income 
results primarily from the provision of capital. 
 
As with interest income, interest expense contains all interest 
expenses, including reversals of premiums/discounts and other 
amounts based on the effective interest method, as well as interest-
like expenses in connection with the ordinary banking business. 
Other interest expenses include the net of interest income and 
interest expenses of hedge accounting items.

(12) Net commission income 
 
The Group reports income and expenses generated from the 
utilisation of services in net commission income. These amounts are 
realised when clients are provided with operational facilities, 
special business relationships or creditworthiness without changing 
the capitalised balance of banking claims. Similarly, commissions 
from the sale of foreign currencies, bank notes and precious metals 
are included in this position, if the activity relates to a service 
transaction and not to proprietary trading. The same applies 
conversely when the Bank utilises third-party services. In the case 
of one-off fees and commissions, e.g. for payment transactions, 
brokerage and lending transactions, which are not included in the 
effective interest rate, commission income is recognised at the 
settlement date. For services rendered over a certain period of time, 
such as payment transactions (annual fees in the credit card 
business and current account business), revenues are recognised 
on the reporting date according to the degree of fulfilment.

1 The items in Others and Consolidation mainly relate to effects from the consolidation of expenses and income. 
 
(13) Net income from financial assets and liabilities measured at 
fair value through profit or loss 
 
This item includes the net income from all financial assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. It contains 
the net gain or loss from financial instruments in the held-for-
trading category, the net gain or loss from financial instruments in 
the mandatorily fair value P&L category, and the net gain or loss 
from financial instruments in the fair value option category. 
The net gain or loss from financial instruments in the held-for-
trading category is the Bank’s net trading income and is reported 
as the net balance of expenses and income. This item therefore 
includes: 
• interest income, including dividends received, and interest 
expenses from financial instruments held for trading; 
• realised gains and losses from the sale of securities held for 
trading purposes, claims, foreign currencies and precious metals; 
• net remeasurement gain or loss from remeasurements to fair 
value; 
• net gain or loss from derivative financial instruments; 
• net gain or loss from fair value adjustments (credit valuation 
adjustment/CVA, debit valuation adjustment/DVA, funding 
valuation adjustment/FVA); 
• commission expenses and income incurred in connection with 
the acquisition or disposal of financial instruments held for 
trading purposes.

• the net gain or loss from financial instruments in the mandatorily 
fair value P&L category and the net gain or loss from financial 
instruments in the fair value option category contain only net 
remeasurement gains or losses and realised profit or loss. 
Expenses and income are each presented on a net basis.

In the reporting period, cash flow hedge accounting was applied 
to hedge interest rate risks from mortgage loans with a nominal 
value of €295m (previous year: €273m) and to hedge foreign 
currency risks from mortgage bonds with a nominal value of 
€300m (previous year: €300m) by means of a cross-currency 
swap. Accordingly, €8m (previous year: €11m) was allocated to 
the cash flow hedge reserve. 
In the financial year, net investment hedge accounting was 
applied for the first time to hedge foreign currency risks arising 
from shipping company investments with a nominal value of  
USD 160m (previous year: USD 150m). Net investment hedge 
accounting was terminated on the reporting date. Accordingly,  
€–5m (previous year: €–3m) was allocated to the currency 
translation reserve. This will be amortised until the financial year 
2026.

(15) Other net income from financial instruments 
 
This item contains the gain or loss on disposal of financial assets in 
the fair value OCI category as well as the gain or loss from the 
repurchase of financial liabilities in the amortised cost category. 
The result from the disposal of financial assets in the amortised 
cost category includes effects from sales of financial instruments 
measured at amortised cost. It also contains the results from 
contractual adjustments agreed when loan arrangements with 
customers are restructured due to a deterioration in their 
creditworthiness (substantial modifications). 
In the case of financial assets in the fair value OCI category (with 
recycling), the difference between amortised cost and fair value is 
recognised in the revaluation reserve until disposal (except for 
impairments) without effect on income, and therefore not in the 
income statement. The revaluation reserve resulting from debt 
securities is reversed through profit or loss when the asset is 
disposed of. 
The disposal of financial liabilities in the amortised cost category 
results in a net realised profit or loss, which arises directly from the 
difference between the sale price and amortised cost. 
This item also includes results from changes in estimates due to 
changes in expectations regarding future cash flows, as well as 
results from non-substantial modifications of financial instruments 
in the amortised cost category.

The Commerzbank Group has loan portfolios totalling €302bn 
(previous year: €299bn) with financial instruments measured at 
amortised cost. This classification requires that the financial 
instruments included therein be allocated to a portfolio with the 
“hold to collect” business model and that no SPPI-non-compliant 
side agreements exist. These portfolios can involve not only 
redemptions but also sales of assets, while still remaining 
fundamentally in compliance with this business model. This is 
particularly the case if the debtor’s credit rating has deteriorated 
significantly or the asset no longer corresponds to the required 
criteria as set out in the internal guidelines, or if the sale is the result 
of portfolio reallocations just prior to the maturity of these assets.  
The net gain or loss from the sale of financial instruments  
(AC portfolios) resulted from the sale of debt instruments, 
promissory note loans and other loans as part of permitted sales of 
AC-portfolios. 
Commerzbank modifies some of the contractual terms of loans 
granted, as part of non-substantial modifications that do not result 
in the derecognition of the previous financial instrument. The 
default risk of these assets after the change is measured as at the 
respective reporting date and compared with the risk under the 
original conditions. Amortised cost before modification amounted 
to €247m (previous year: €188m).

companies accounted for using the equity method, which was reported 
in other net income and amounted to €–16m (previous year: €4m),

and result primarily from the adjustment of restructuring provisions 
(see Note 54, Other provisions, b) Miscellaneous provisions) and 
increased depreciation of both leased assets and office furniture and 
equipment due to a reduction in the remaining useful life in 
connection with restructuring measures (see Note 45).

The combined income tax rate applicable to Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft and its German subsidiaries was 31.5%. 
The following reconciliation shows the relationship between net 
pre-tax profit according to IFRS and taxes on income in the financial 
year. 
The Group income tax rate selected as a basis for the 
reconciliation is made up of the corporate income tax rate of 15.0% 
applied in Germany, plus the solidarity surcharge of 5.5% and an 
average rate of 15.7% for trade tax. This yields a German income 
tax rate of 31.5% (previous year: 31.5%).  
Income tax effects result from discrepancies between the tax 
rates applying to foreign units. Tax rates outside Germany ranged 
between 10.0% (Bulgaria) (previous year: 10.0% (Dubai)) and  
45.0% (Brazil) (previous year: 45.0%). 
As at 31 December 2023, the Group tax rate was 34.9% 
(previous year: 30.5%).

The change in the difference between deferred tax assets and 
liabilities may differ from the change in the difference between 
deferred tax expenses and income. This is generally due to:  
• deferred taxes that are charged or credited directly to equity  
• the effects of exchange rate changes on tax assets and liabilities 
that are denominated in currencies other than the euro  
• acquisitions and disposals of companies in the ordinary course

Financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IFRS 9 
General classification and measurement 
In accordance with IFRS 9, all financial assets and liabilities – which 
also include derivative financial instruments – must be recognised 
in the balance sheet. A financial instrument is a contract that gives 
rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another. On initial recognition, financial instruments 
are measured at fair value. For financial instruments that are not 
measured at fair value through profit and loss, directly attributable 
transaction costs are included in the fair values as acquisition-
related costs, which increase the fair value of financial assets or 
reduce the fair value of financial liabilities. In accordance with 
IFRS 13, fair value is defined as the exit price, i.e. the price that the 
market participant would receive for the sale of an asset or pay to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. The fair value is a price 
observed on an active market (mark-to-market) or determined using 
valuation models (mark-to-model). The relevant inputs for the 
valuation model are either observed directly on the market or, if not 
observable on the market, are estimates made by experts. 
In 
subsequent 
measurement, 
financial 
instruments 
are 
recognised in the balance sheet either at (amortised) cost or at fair 
value, depending on the category.  
a) Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments 
A financial asset or a financial liability is generally recognised in the 
balance sheet when Commerzbank Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the financial instrument. For regular-way 
purchases or sales of financial assets in the cash market the trading 
and settlement dates normally differ. These regular-way cash 
market purchases and sales may be recognised using either trade 
date or settlement date accounting. In the Commerzbank Group, 
regular-way cash market purchases and sales of financial assets are 
accounted for on their recognition and disposal on the trade date. 
The derecognition rules of IFRS 9 are based both on the concept 
of risks and rewards and on the concept of control. However, when 
deciding whether an asset qualifies for derecognition, the 
evaluation of the transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership 
takes precedence over the evaluation of the transfer of control. If 
the risks and rewards are transferred only partially and control over 
the asset is retained, the continuing involvement approach is used. 
The financial asset continues to be recognised to the extent of the 
Group’s continuing involvement, and special accounting policies 
apply. The extent of the continuing involvement is the extent to 
which the Group is exposed to changes in the value of the 
transferred asset. A financial liability (or part of a financial liability) 
is derecognised when it is extinguished, i.e. when the obligations 
arising from the contract are discharged or cancelled or expire. The 
repurchase of own debt instruments is also a transfer of financial 
liabilities that qualifies for derecognition. Any differences between 
the carrying value of the liability (including discounts and premiums) 
and the purchase price are recognised in profit or loss; if the asset 
is sold again at a later date a new financial liability is recognised at 
cost equal to the price at which the asset was sold. Differences 
between this cost and the repayment amount are allocated over the 
term of the debt instrument using the effective interest rate method. 
Some amendments of contractual terms and conditions between 
borrowers and the Bank, for example as a consequence of 
forbearance measures or restructuring, can lead to derecognition. 
A substantial modification of the contractual terms and conditions 
of a financial instrument between an existing borrower and the 
Bank leads to the derecognition of the original financial asset and 
the recognition of a new financial instrument.  
Similarly, a substantial modification of the contractual terms and 
conditions of an existing debt instrument is to be treated as a 
repayment of the original financial liability. In quantitative terms, an 
amendment of the contractual terms and conditions is regarded as 
substantive if the discounted net present value of the cash flows 
under the new contractual terms and conditions varies by at least 
10% from the discounted net present value of the residual cash 
flows of the original debt instrument. 
b)  Classification of financial instruments and their measurement 
The Commerzbank Group classifies financial assets and financial 
liabilities in accordance with the applicable IFRS 9 categories: 
Financial assets 
• Amortised cost (AC) 
• Fair value OCI (FVOCI) 
• Mandatorily fair value P&L (mFVPL) 
• Held for trading (HFT) 
 
 
 
 
 
296 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Financial liabilities 
• Amortised cost (AC) 
• Fair value option (FVO) 
• Held for trading (HFT) 
 
The Group subdivides the IFRS 9 categories into the following 
classes: 
Financial assets 
• Loans and advances 
• Debt securities 
• Equity instruments 
• Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
(stand-alone derivatives) 
• Derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting 
 
Financial liabilities 
• Deposits 
• Debt securities issued 
• Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
(stand-alone derivatives) 
• Derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting 
• Financial guarantees 
 
Additionally, we report lending commitments (revocable and 
irrevocable). 
c) Net gains or losses  
Net gains or losses include fair value measurements recognised 
in profit or loss, currency translation effects, impairments, write-
ups of impairments, gains realised on disposal, subsequent 
recoveries on written-down financial instruments and changes 
recognised in the revaluation reserve classified in the respective 
IFRS 9 categories. The components are detailed in the 
condensed statement of comprehensive income and in the notes 
on net interest income, risk result, net income from financial 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit and 
loss and other net income from financial instruments. 
 
d) Financial guarantees 
A financial guarantee is a contract that requires the issuer to 
make specified payments that reimburse the holder for a loss 
they incur because a specified debtor fails to make payment 
when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a 
debt instrument. This may include, for example, bank guarantees. 
If Commerzbank Group is the guarantee holder, the financial 
guarantee is not recorded in the accounts and is only recognised 
when determining an impairment of a guaranteed asset. As the 
issuer, Commerzbank Group recognises the liability arising from 
a financial guarantee at inception. Initial measurement is at fair 
value at the time of recognition. In general terms, the fair value 
of a financial guarantee contract at inception is zero because for 
fair market contracts the value of the premium agreed normally 
corresponds to the value of the guarantee obligation (net 
method). Subsequent measurement is at the higher of amortised 
cost or the provision that is required to be recognised if payment 
of the guarantee becomes probable. 
e) Embedded derivatives 
Embedded derivatives are derivatives that are integrated into 
primary financial instruments. These include, for example, 
reverse convertible bonds (bonds that may be repaid in the form 
of equities) or bonds with index-linked interest payments. 
In accordance with IFRS 9, we only separate those derivatives 
that are embedded in financial liabilities. Financial assets are 
assessed in their entirety, meaning that the host contract is not 
accounted for separately from the embedded derivative. Instead, 
financial assets are classified based on the business model and 
their contractual terms and conditions. 
In the case of financial liabilities, such a separation for 
accounting purposes is only required if the following three 
conditions are met: 
• The economic characteristics and risks of the embedded 
derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract. 
• A separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded 
derivative would meet the definition of a derivative under 
IFRS 9. 
• The primary financial liability is not measured at fair value 
through profit or loss. 
In this case, the embedded derivative to be separated is 
regarded as part of the held-for-trading category and is 
recognised at fair value. Changes on remeasurement are 
recognised in the net income from financial assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value through profit and loss. The host contract 
is accounted for and measured applying the rules of the category 
to which the financial instrument is assigned. 
If the above three conditions are not cumulatively met, the 
embedded derivative is not shown separately and the total 
financial instrument or structured product is measured as a whole 
in accordance with the general provisions of the category to which 
the financial liability is assigned.

(24) Financial assets – Amortised cost 
 
If the contractually agreed cash flows of a financial asset comprise 
only interest and principal payments (i.e. the asset is SPPI-
compliant) and this asset was allocated to the “hold to collect” 
business model, it is measured at amortised cost. The carrying 
amount of these financial instruments is reduced by the loan loss 
provision (see Note 31). 
If ESG clauses are part of contracts for financial instruments, in 
most cases these have only a negligible influence on contractual 
cash flows and thus on the measurement of these financial 
instruments at amortised cost or fair value. The possible 
implications of ESG clauses on the classification and accounting of 
financial instruments are examined within the framework of 
established processes (e.g. new product process). 
Interest income for these financial instruments are recognised in 
net interest income using the effective interest method.

The business model for a portfolio of promissory note loans issued 
by British public-sector bodies, which had a carrying amount of 
€2.8bn, was changed as of 1 January 2019. As part of the closure of 
the Asset & Capital Recovery segment (run-off portfolio), this 
portfolio was grouped under Treasury and has been administered 
by the Investment Office since 1 January 2019 (see also Note 57). 
Distribution and sales activities for the portfolio have been 
discontinued. As of 1 January 2019, future sales for this portfolio 
are now only permitted in the event of a significant deterioration in 
credit 
quality. 
Portfolio 
management 
and 
management 
remuneration are therefore no longer based on fair value. The 
objective of the portfolio is to generate contractually agreed cash 
flows. The contractually agreed cash flows are solely payments of 
interest and principal for the purposes of IFRS 9. The change of 
business model resulted in reclassification from the mFVPL 
measurement category to the AC measurement category.  
The effective interest rate calculated at the time of 
reclassification was 2.8%. In the 2023 financial year the interest 
income for the reclassified portfolio amounted to €77m (previous 
year: €88m). There was no interest expense in the current financial 
year or the previous financial year. 
The fair value of the portfolio at 31 December 2023 was €0.9bn 
(previous year: €1.6bn). The decrease in fair value is due in 
particular to the use of the termination option by our counterparts. 
If the portfolio had remained in the mFVPL measurement category, 
the fair value change since the start of the year and the offsetting 
change in value of the derivatives held to hedge the portfolio would 
have been recognised in the income statement under net income 
from financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through 
profit or loss. This would have resulted in net income of €157m 
(previous year: €42m), which would have been the consequence of 
both credit spread and interest rate-related effects. Since 
reclassification, the cash flows of the underlying transactions of the 
portfolio have been assigned to the portfolio fair value hedge 
accounting of Commerzbank.

(25) Financial liabilities – Amortised cost 
 
 
As a rule, financial liabilities must be subsequently measured at 
amortised cost. 
Deposits include primarily deposits due on demand, term 
deposits and savings deposits. 
In other debt issues we also report those subordinated 
securitised and unsecuritised issues which in the event of an 
insolvency or liquidation can be repaid only after the claims of all 
non-subordinated creditors have been satisfied.

Commerzbank has been participating in the ECB’s third programme 
of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) since 
2020. Of the total €35.9bn, €27bn were repaid in the fourth quarter 
of 2022 and €5.4bn in the second quarter 2023. The interest rate 
depends on the development of the credit volume in a benchmark 
portfolio, which, if a threshold has been reached, results in a 
discount on the rate. Commerzbank reached the threshold in 2021 
and utilised the interest rate discounts. Interest income was 
essentially recognised in net interest income on a pro rata basis with 
a corresponding reduction of the refinancing liability. Due to several 
increases in key interest rates in the second half of the financial year 
2022, there is no longer any need under IAS 20 to recognise an 
interest rate subsidy for the time to maturity. In 2023, this resulted 
in an interest expenses of €–197m (previous year: €190m).

(26) Financial assets – Fair value OCI 
 
Measurement at fair value with recognition of the change in value 
in other comprehensive income with recycling (FVOCI with 
recycling) is required if the financial instrument is allocated to a 
portfolio with the “hold to collect and sell” business model and, in 
addition, the contractually agreed cash flows are solely interest and 
principal payments and are thus SPPI-compliant. 
The changes in fair value are recognised in the revaluation 
reserve without effect on income, except for impairments, which are 
recognised in the income statement. The recognition of loan loss 
provisions is explained in Note 31 “Credit risks and credit losses”. 
When a financial instrument is derecognised, the accumulated gains 
and losses recognised to date in the revaluation reserve are 
reclassified to the income statement (recycling) and reported in 
other net income from financial instruments. Interest income from 
these financial assets is recognised in net interest income using the 
effective interest method. 
In addition, the financial assets – fair value OCI also include 
equity instruments for which we have chosen the option of fair value 
measurement without recycling with no effect on income, provided 
that these meet the definition of equity in accordance with IAS 32, 
if they are in scope of IFRS 9 and are not held for trading purposes. 
Such a classification is set voluntarily and irrevocably per financial 
instrument. Gains or losses from these equity instruments are never 
reclassified to the income statement, rather they are reclassified 
into retained earnings when sold (without recycling). These equity 
instruments are not subject to impairment testing. Any dividends 
paid on these instruments are recognised as dividend income in the 
income statement, provided they do not involve a return of capital.

(27) Financial liabilities – Fair value option 
 
Under IFRS 9 rules, in the case of an accounting mismatch, the 
management of financial liabilities on a fair value basis and the 
existence of embedded derivatives requiring separation may also be 
conditions for applying the fair value option to liabilities. 
 
If the fair value option is used for financial liabilities or for hybrid 
contracts, the changes in fair value resulting from fluctuations in 
own credit risk are not recognised in the income statement, but in 
other comprehensive income (without recycling) with no effect on 
income.

For liabilities to which the fair value option was applied, the change 
in fair value in the 2023 financial year for credit risk reasons was  
€181m (previous year: €–181m). The cumulative change was 
€121m (previous year: €–60m). The repayment amount of financial 
liabilities measured at fair value was €7,249m (previous year: 
€5,371m).  
€131m (previous year: €–147m) realised from disposals of 
financial liabilities for which the fair value option was applied was 
recognised in retained earnings without effect on income. The 
credit risk-specific changes in the fair value of liabilities were 
primarily calculated as changes in fair values less value changes 
resulting from market conditions. 
Applying the fair value option in order to avoid accounting 
mismatches and for financial instruments with embedded 
derivatives produced the following values in the “Financial 
liabilities – Fair value option” category:

(28) Financial assets – Mandatorily fair value P&L 
 
This item includes financial instruments that are allocated as debt 
instruments to the residual business model as a differentiation from 
the equity instruments listed below and not reported in “Financial 
assets – Held for trading”. In addition, transactions allocated to the 
“hold to collect” and “hold to collect and sell” business model are 
included here if they are not SPPI-compliant. Examples of such 
transactions 
include 
investment 
fund 
units, 
profit-sharing 
certificates, silent participations and assets managed on a fair value 
basis. 
Equity instruments are exclusively contracts providing a residual 
interest in the assets of a company after deducting all associated 
debts, such as shares or interests in other joint-stock companies. 
Equity instruments are not SPPI-compliant because the investor 
has no claim to interest and principal repayments. As a result, these 
instruments are usually measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
An exception to this rule exists for equity instruments for which the 
Group has chosen the option to measure them at fair value in other 
comprehensive income without recycling (see Note 26).

Financial assets and liabilities – Held for Trading 
(29) Financial assets – Held for trading 
 
This category includes interest- and equity-related securities, 
promissory note loans and other claims as well as other trading 
portfolios allocated to the residual business model and held for 
trading. These financial instruments are used to realise profits from 
short-term fluctuations in prices or traders’ margins. Derivative 
financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 
also reported here. 
Irrespective of the type of product, these financial assets are 
measured at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value changes 
of the respective transactions are therefore reported through profit 
or loss in the income statement. If the fair value cannot be 
established on an active market, items are measured by means of 
comparable prices, indicative prices of pricing service providers or 
other banks (lead managers), or internal valuation models (net 
present value or option pricing models).  
Interest income and expenses and gains or losses on 
measurement and disposal from these financial instruments are 
recorded in the income statement under net income from financial 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
(31) Credit risks and credit losses 
Principles and measurements  
IFRS 9 stipulates that impairments for credit risks from loans and 
securities that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss 
must be recognised using a three-stage model based on expected 
credit losses.  
In the Commerzbank Group, the following financial instruments 
are included in the scope of this impairment model: 
• financial assets in the form of loans and advances as well as debt 
securities measured at amortised cost; 
• financial assets in the form of loans and advances as well as debt 
securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI); 
• lease receivables; 
• lending commitments (revocable ansd irrevocable) which under 
IFRS 9 are not measured at fair value through profit or loss;  
• financial guarantees within the scope of IFRS 9 that are not 
measured at fair value through profit or loss; 
 
The Group determines the impairment using a three-stage 
model based on the following requirements: 
In stage 1, as a rule all financial instruments are recognised if 
their risk of a loan loss (hereinafter default risk) has not increased 
significantly 
since 
their 
initial 
recognition. 
In 
addition, 
Commerzbank makes use of the option in accordance with IFRS 9 
B 5.5.23 (low credit risk exception or LCRE) and classifies 
transactions that have a limited default risk on the reporting date as 
stage 1. These are securities as well as financial instruments with 
states, local or regional authorities of the OECD whose internal 
credit rating on the reporting date is in the investment grade range 
(corresponding to Commerzbank rating 2.8 or better). For financial 
instruments in stage 1, an impairment must be recognised in the 
amount of the expected credit losses from possible events of default 
over the term of the transaction, subject to a maximum of 12 months 
(12-month ECL).  
Stage 2 includes those financial instruments with a default risk 
that has increased significantly since their initial recognition and 
which, as at the reporting date, are not subject to the LCRE. In 
addition to a client-specific change in the probability of default (PD), 
Commerzbank defines further criteria whose presence is assumed 
to denote a significant increase in default risk. Instruments are then 
allocated to stage 2 independently of the individual change in PD. 
Impairments in stage 2 are recognised in the amount of the financial 
instrument’s lifetime expected credit loss (LECL). For financial 
instruments that are committed for an unlimited period (open 
transactions), a top-down approach is used to determine the LECL 
as a percentage of the current loss at default (LaD) on the basis of 
realised historical losses.  
Financial instruments that are classified as impaired as at the 
reporting date are allocated to stage 3. As the criterion for this, 
Commerzbank uses its definition of a default pursuant to Article 178 
CRR as well as the supplementary EBA guidance on the application 
of the definition of default pursuant to Article 178 of Regulation (EU) 
No. 575/2013. This approach is consistent because the ECL 
calculation also uses statistical risk parameters derived from the 
Basel IRB approach, which are modified to meet the requirements 
of IFRS 9.  
The following events can be indicative of a customer default: 
• over 90 days past due; 
• unlikely to pay; 
• financial rescue/distressed restructuring with concessions; 
• the Bank has demanded immediate repayment of its claims; 
• the customer is in insolvency. 
 
The LECL is likewise used as the value of the required 
impairment for stage-3 financial instruments in default. When 
determining the LECL, the Group distinguishes in principle 
between significant and insignificant cases. The amount of the 
LECL for insignificant transactions (volumes up to €5m) is 
determined based on statistical risk parameters. The LECL for 
significant transactions (volumes greater than €5m) is the expected 
value of the losses derived from individual expert assessments of 
future cash flows based on several potential scenarios and their 
probability of occurrence. The scenarios and probabilities are based 
on assessments by recovery and resolution specialists. For each 
scenario – without regard to whether it is a continuation or sale 
scenario – the timing and amount of the expected future cash flows 
are estimated. Both the customer-specific and the macroeconomic 
situation are taken into account (for example currency restrictions, 
currency value fluctuations, commodity price developments), as 
well as the sector environment, with a view to the future. The 
estimate is also based on external information. Sources include 
indices (e.g. World Corruption Index), forecasts (e.g. by the IMF), 
information from global associations of financial service providers 
(e.g. the Institute of International Finance) and publications from 
rating agencies and auditing firms.

406 Independent Auditor´s Report 
If a default criterion no longer applies, the financial instrument 
recovers and, after the applicable probation period has been 
adhered to, is no longer allocated to stage 3. After recovery, a new 
assessment is made based on the updated rating information to see 
if the default risk has increased significantly since initial recognition 
in the balance sheet and the instrument is allocated to stage 1 or 
stage 2 accordingly. 
Financial instruments which when initially recognised are 
already considered impaired as per the aforementioned definition 
(“purchased or originated credit-impaired”, or “POCI”, financial 
instruments) are handled outside the three-stage impairment model 
and are therefore not allocated to any of the three stages. The initial 
recognition is based on fair value without recording an impairment, 
but using an effective interest rate that is adjusted for 
creditworthiness. The impairment recognised in the income 
statement in subsequent periods equals the cumulative change in 
the LECL since the initial recognition in the balance sheet. The 
LECL remains the basis for the measurement, even if the value of 
the financial instrument has increased. 
Claims are written off in the balance sheet as soon as it is 
reasonable to assume that a financial asset is not realisable in full 
or in part and that the claims are therefore uncollectible. 
Uncollectibility may arise in the settlement process for various 
objective reasons, such as the demise of the borrower without 
realisable assets in the estate or completion of insolvency 
proceedings without further prospect of payments. Moreover, loans 
are generally regarded as (partially) uncollectible at the latest  
720 days after their due date and are (partially) written down to the 
expected recoverable amount within the framework of existing loan 
loss provisions. Such a (partial) write-down has no direct impact on 
ongoing debt collection measures. 
Assessment of a significant increase in default risk 
Commerzbank’s rating systems combine into the customer-specific 
probability of default (PD) all available quantitative and qualitative 
information relevant for forecasting the default risk. This metric is 
based primarily on a statistical selection and weighting of all 
available indicators. In addition, the PD adjusted in accordance with 
IFRS 9 requirements takes into account not only historical 
information and the current economic environment but also, in 
particular, forward-looking information such as the forecast for the 
development of macroeconomic conditions. 
Commerzbank essentially uses the probability of default (PD) as 
a frame of reference for assessing whether the default risk of a 
financial instrument has increased significantly since the date of its 
initial recognition. By anchoring the review of the relative transfer 
criterion in the robust processes and procedures of the Bank’s 
Group-wide credit risk management framework (in particular, early 
identification of credit risk, controlling of overdrafts and the  
re-rating process), the Bank ensures that a significant increase in 
the default risk is identified in a reliable and timely manner based 
on objective criteria.  
Commerzbank applies some key additional criteria for the 
allocation to stage 2. These are: 
• clients for whom a financial instrument is significantly 
overdrawn for more than 20 days; 
• clients in intensive care whose Commerzbank credit rating is 4.6 
or worse on the reporting date; 
• clients in intensive care whose Commerzbank credit rating on 
the reporting date is 4.0 or worse and whose external credit 
rating is 5.0 or worse; 
• customers who are granted a forbearance measure according to 
Article 47b CRR that does not lead to a default (stage 3); 
• financial instruments whose PD on the reporting date has at least 
tripled compared to the PD originally recognised in the balance 
sheet and which have a credit rating higher than 2.8 on the 
reporting date (backstop indicator “threefold PD”). 
For further information on the procedures and processes as well 
as the governance in credit risk management at Commerzbank, 
please refer to the statements in the Group Management Report 
(page 216 ff.). 
The review to determine whether the default risk as at the 
financial reporting date has risen significantly since the initial 
recognition of the respective financial instrument is performed as 
at the end of the reporting period. This review compares the 
observed probability of default over the residual maturity of the 
financial instrument (lifetime PD) against the lifetime PD over the 
same period as expected on the date of initial recognition. In 
accordance with IFRS requirements, the original and current PD are 
compared based on the probability of default over a period of  
12 months after the end of the reporting period (12-month PD). In 
these cases, the Bank uses equivalence analyses to demonstrate 
that no material variances have occurred compared with an 
assessment using the lifetime PD. 
A quantile and then thresholds in the form of rating levels are set 
using a statistical procedure in order to determine whether an 
increase in the PD compared with the initial recognition date is 
“significant”. These thresholds, which are differentiated by rating 
models, represent a critical degree of variance from the expectation 
of the average PD development. If the current PD exceeds this 
threshold, a critical deviation is present and leads to an assignment 
to stage 2. In order to ensure an economically sound allocation of 
the stage, transaction-specific factors are taken into account, 
including the extent of the PD at the initial recognition date, the 
term (to date) and the remaining term of the transaction.  
 
 
 
306 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Commerzbank generally refrains from checking whether there is 
a significant increase in the default risk as at the reporting date 
compared to the time of acquisition of the relevant financial 
instrument for those transactions for which there is a low default 
risk as at the reporting date (IFRS 9 B 5.5.23 option). These are 
securities as well as financial instruments with states, local or 
regional authorities of the OECD whose internal credit rating on the 
reporting date is in the investment grade range (corresponding to 
Commerzbank rating 2.8 or better).  
Financial instruments are retransferred from stage 2 to stage 1 
if at the end of the reporting period the default risk is no longer 
significantly elevated compared with the initial recognition date. 
Calculation of expected credit loss  
Commerzbank calculates the ECL as the probability-weighted, 
unbiased and discounted expected value of future loan losses over 
the total residual maturity of the respective financial instrument. 
The 12-month ECL used for the recognition of impairments in 
stage 1 is the portion of the LECL that results from default events 
which are expected to occur within 12 months following the end of 
the reporting period. 
The ECL for stage 1 and stage 2 as well as for insignificant 
financial instruments in stage 3 is determined on an individual 
transaction basis taking into account statistical risk parameters. 
These parameters have been derived from the Basel IRB approach 
and modified to meet the requirements of IFRS 9.  
The significant main parameters used in this determination 
include: 
• the customer-specific probability of default (PD); 
• the loss given default (LGD); and 
• the exposure at default (EaD). 
All risk parameters used from the Bank’s internal models have 
been adjusted to meet the specific requirements of IFRS 9, and the 
forecast horizon has been extended accordingly to cover the entire 
term of the financial instruments. For example, the forecast for the 
development of the exposure over the entire term of the financial 
instrument therefore also includes, in particular, contractual and 
statutory termination rights. 
In the case of loan products that consist of a utilised loan amount 
and an open credit line and for which in customary commercial 
practice the credit risk is not limited to the contractual notice period 
(at Commerzbank this relates primarily to revolving products 
without a contractually agreed repayment structure, such as 
overdrafts and credit card facilities), the LECL must be determined 
using a behavioural maturity, which typically exceeds the maximum 
contractual period. In order to ensure that the LECL for these 
products is determined in an empirically sound manner in 
compliance with IFRS 9 requirements, Commerzbank calculates the 
LECL directly for these products based on realised historical losses. 
In order to reflect expected effects at an early stage, the risk 
result as at 31 December 2023 includes a one-time charge totalling 
€37m in respect of the expected adjustment of the PD and LGD 
models for Commerzbank’s CORES, COSCO and RCORP rating 
processes to the new Future of the IRB regulatory standard. This 
reflects, among other things, an additional requirement for level 3 
LGD models amounting to €18m during the year, which has been 
taken into account since the 2021 annual financial statements. 
As a rule, the Group estimates the risk parameters specific to 
IFRS 9 based not only on historical default information but also, in 
particular, on the current economic environment (point-in-time 
perspective) and forward-looking information. This assessment 
primarily involves reviewing the effects which the Bank’s 
macroeconomic forecasts will have regarding the amount of the 
ECL and including these effects in the determination of the ECL.  
This is based on an expert estimate derived from the 
macroeconomic scenario, which takes account of factors such as 
GDP growth, inflation, long-term interest rate developments and the 
unemployment rate. The baseline scenario specifies ranges for this.  
The baseline scenario was checked for consistency with 
mBank’s baseline scenario with regard to the main scenarios.  
The baseline scenario reflects economic uncertainties and 
geopolitical tensions as at the reporting date and includes the 
following material assumptions:  
• The global economy continues to suffer as a result of geopolitical 
tensions (e.g. the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Middle East 
conflict) and the widespread tightening of monetary policy. 
• Positive effects resulting from the gradual resolution of supply 
chain issues and from the easing in energy markets are not 
sufficient to make up for the negative effects of a restrictive 
monetary policy, which, with a time lag, is increasingly acting as 
a drag on economic activity.  
• The eurozone economy is suffering as a consequence of the high 
interest rate environment, which is having a sharply negative 
impact on capital expenditure, on consumer spending and 
specifically on sectors such as real estate. 
• The German economy will remain weak because, in addition to 
the high interest rate environment, it is also having to cope with 
a contraction in demand from abroad. 
The baseline scenario takes the following assumptions regarding 
growth, inflation, long-term interest rate trends and the 
unemployment rate into consideration:

We therefore expect economic performance to be slightly 
weaker than forecast by the ECB and Deutsche Bundesbank in 
December 2023. 
On the reporting date, the expected credit loss for stages 1 and 
2 (including the secondary effects TLA contained therein (€453m)), 
calculated on the basis of the baseline scenario described above, 
was €1.6bn. 
In order to determine these effects, it was ensured that the 
relevant experts are sufficiently involved within the framework of 
the existing policies. 
Potential effects from non-linear correlations between different 
macroeconomic scenarios and the LECL are corrected using a 
separately determined adjustment factor. The factor was reviewed 
on an event-driven basis during the year and in the fourth quarter 
of 2023, compared to the previous year, slightly decreased. The 
baseline scenario as well as a pessimistic and an optimistic scenario 
were used to determine the factor. The weightings for the individual 
scenarios are also always determined by relevant experts and are 
regulated in a policy.  
The main assumptions in the pessimistic scenario are that 
pressure on the European energy markets will return in 2024 and 
rising energy prices will place a major strain on energy-intensive 
industries, the transport sector and private households. Coupled 
with this, the adverse effects of the current global restrictive 
monetary policy will impede economic activity more than expected 
in the baseline scenario. The Bank has simulated in an additional 
analysis that the estimated expected credit loss (stages 1 and 2) 
would increase by approximately €0.6bn if – contrary to current 
expectations – this pessimistic scenario were to materialise.  
In this pessimistic scenario, the estimated expected credit loss 
(stages 1 and 2) would increase by €0.6bn. The methodology used 
to determine the ECL model result is the same as the methodology 
used to determine the secondary effects TLA in the baseline 
scenario. 
The optimistic scenario is based on the underlying assumption 
that the negative effects of the restrictive monetary policy are less 
serious than expected in the baseline scenario. It is assumed that 
the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has ended and an 
expansion of the conflict in the Middle East has been prevented. 
The risk of an energy crisis continues to decrease and supply chains 
are no longer disrupted.  
In this optimistic scenario, the estimated expected credit loss 
(stages 1 and 2) would decrease by €0.4bn.  
The table below provides an overview of the most important 
underlying macroeconomic parameters in the optimistic and 
pessimistic scenarios, which were subsequently translated into

IFRS 9 requires the inclusion of forward-looking information 
when determining the expected credit loss. However, the IFRS 9 
ECL model result implemented at Commerzbank does not take into 
account forward-looking effects resulting from unforeseeable, 
singular events such as natural disasters, material political 
decisions or military conflicts. Such risks can be provided for by a 
top-level adjustment (TLA). The examination with the involvement 
of senior management as to whether such TLAs are necessary, as 
well as their possible implementation, are regulated in a policy.  
In the 2023 financial year, such an adjustment to the IFRS 9 ECL 
model result was again deemed necessary because the negative 
effects expected in the baseline scenario are not fully covered by 
the parameters used in the corresponding models.  
The methodology used for determining the need for adjustments 
to the ECL model result corresponds to the methodology used for 
determining the secondary effects TLA in 2022.  
The effects of the adjustments on the stage allocation were taken 
into account in the calculation of the TLA. This booking was 
portfolio-based. It is shown in the presentation of the change in loan 
loss provisions in the line “Changes of parameters and models”. No

For more information on ECL and TLA, see the Group risk report

Group loan loss provisions, it is necessary to make assumptions that 
are subject to high estimation uncertainty, particularly in a dynamic 
environment.

406 Independent Auditor´s Report 
In this depiction, a financial instrument is defined as new business 
if the relevant date for assessing a significant increase in default risk 
lies within the reporting period. This population may therefore 
differ from other new business surveys, for example those for sales 
management.  
The changes in positions resulting from stage transfers show the 
allocations and reversals resulting from a change in assignment to 
stages during the reporting period. During the transfer, the position 
in the previous stage is completely reversed and the whole target 
position is added in the new stage. Disposals include reversals of 
loss provisions for transactions that were derecognised from the 
balance sheet during the reporting period. The line “Changes in 
parameters and models” contains changes in positions attributable 
to changes in risk provisioning parameters. This includes changes 
in utilisation (e.g. as a result of repayments) as well as changes in 
collateral securities and changes in probability of default that did 
not lead to a change in stage. What is more, adjustment effects from 
regular parameter reviews and from changed macroeconomic 
expectations as well as the TLA booked in the reporting period are 
shown here. The utilisation reflects the extent to which the risk 
provision was reduced by write-downs not recognised in the income 
statement. The line “Exchange rate changes/reclassifications” 
shows the currency effects and, where applicable, transfers from 
reclassifications. 
The presentation is based on postings for individual transactions. 
At customer level, it may therefore happen that several items in the 
schedule are addressed. For example, both new business and 
disposals may be included. No offsetting is carried out. 
Claims totalling €298m were (partially) written down in the 
reporting period. Collection activities continue to be performed 
regarding these claims. 
The gross carrying amounts of the financial assets for which 
value adjustments have been made changed as follows in the period 
under review:

(32) Concentration of credit risk 
 
Concentrations of credit risk may arise through business relations 
with individual borrowers or groups of borrowers which share a 
number of features and whose ability to service debt is influenced 
to the same extent by changes in certain overall economic 
conditions. Besides obtaining collateral and applying a uniform 
lending policy, the Bank has entered into a number of master 
netting agreements to minimise credit risks. These give the Bank 
the right to net claims on and liabilities against a customer in the 
event of the default or insolvency of that customer. The gross 
carrying amounts of credit risks relating to loans and advances, 
lending commitments, financial guarantees and other indemnity 
agreements were as follows:

The carrying amounts of credit risk concentrations in loans and 
advances, lending commitments, financial guarantees and other 
indemnity agreements shown in the tables above are not part of 
internal credit risk management, as credit risk management also 
takes account of collateral, probabilities of default and other 
economic factors. To this extent these amounts are therefore not 
representative of the Bank’s assessment of its actual credit risk. 
 
(33) Maximum credit risk 
 
The maximum credit risk exposure – excluding collateral and other 
credit enhancements – is equal to the carrying amounts of the 
relevant assets in each class, or the nominal values of irrevocable 
lending commitments and financial guarantees. The table below 
shows the carrying amounts or nominal values of financial 
instruments with a potential default risk:

(34) Securitisation of loans 
 
The use of credit derivatives (such as credit default swaps, total 
return swaps and credit-linked notes) can reduce the risk weighting 
of a loan portfolio. The hedging effect of a credit derivative may 
relate both to individual loans or securities and to entire portfolios 
of loans or securities. As a rule, security is furnished by means of a 
synthetic securitisation by credit default swaps (CDS) and/or by 
credit-linked notes (CLNs). This enables three important goals to be 
achieved: 
• risk diversification (reduction of credit risks in the portfolio, 
especially concentration risks); 
• easing the burden on equity capital (the transfer of credit risks 
to investors leads to a reduction in the regulatory capital 
requirements);  
• funding (use of securitisation as an alternative funding 
instrument to unsecured bearer bonds). 
 
As at the end of the 2023 financial year, Commerzbank Group 
had launched six securitisation transactions as the buyer of 
protection. 
Overall, a total volume of €13.2bn (previous year: €14.1bn) of 
loans to customers had been hedged by end of December 2023. 
This reduced the Bank’s risk-weighted assets by €5.1bn (previous 
year: €4.4bn).

(35) IFRS 13 fair value hierarchies and disclosure requirements 
 
Fair value hierarchy 
Commerzbank classifies financial instruments in a three-level fair 
value measurement hierarchy as follows: 
• Level 1: Financial instruments whose fair values are determined 
as the quoted prices for identical financial instruments in active 
markets. 
• Level 2: Financial instruments where no quoted prices are 
available for identical instruments in an active market and the 
fair value is established using valuation techniques which rely 
on observable market parameters.  
• Level 3: Financial instruments where valuation techniques are 
used that incorporate at least one input for which there is 
insufficient observable market data and where at least this input 
has a more than insignificant impact on the fair value. 
 
An ongoing assessment of the market takes place to determine 
whether it is active or not. The market will be determined to be 
active if there is a sufficient number of available prices, i.e. when 
there are enough price sources for the relevant parameter to be 
considered observable. If the market is active, the prices will  
be used (Level 1). If the market is inactive, a model approach can 
be followed. 
With respect to the methods of model-based measurements 
(level 2 and level 3) relevant for banks, IFRS 13 recognises the 
market approach and the income approach. The market approach 
relies on measurement methods that draw on information about 
identical or comparable assets and liabilities. 
The income approach reflects current expectations about future 
cash flows, expenses and income. The income approach may also 
include option price models. These valuations are subject to a 
higher degree to judgements by management. Market data or third-
party inputs are relied on to the greatest possible extent, and 
company-specific inputs to a limited degree. 
All fair values are subject to Commerzbank Group’s internal 
controls and procedures, which set out the standards for 
independently verifying or validating fair values. These controls and 
procedures are carried out and coordinated by the Independent 
Price Verification (IPV) Group within the risk function. The models, 
inputs and resulting fair values are reviewed regularly by senior 
management and the risk function. 
Disclosure obligations 
Below, a distinction is made between: 
a) financial instruments measured at fair value (fair value OCI, fair 
value option, mandatorily fair value P&L and held for trading); 
b) financial instruments measured at amortised cost. 
The respective disclosure requirements regarding these 
financial instruments are set out in IFRS 7 and IFRS 13.  
a) Financial instruments measured at fair value 
According to IFRS 13, the fair value of an asset is the amount for 
which it could be sold between knowledgeable, willing parties in an 
arm’s length transaction. The fair value therefore represents an exit 
price. The fair value of a liability is defined as the price at which the 
debt could be transferred to a third party as part of an orderly 
transaction. 
The measurement of liabilities must also take account of the 
Bank’s own credit spread. If third parties provide security for our 
liabilities (e.g. guarantees), this security is not taken into account in 
the valuation of the liability, as the Bank’s repayment obligation 
remains the same. 
When measuring derivative transactions, the Group uses the 
possibility of establishing net risk positions for financial assets and 
liabilities. The measurement takes into account not only 
counterparty credit risk but also the Bank’s own default risk. The 
Group determines credit valuation adjustments (CVAs) and debit 
valuation adjustments (DVAs) by simulating the future fair values of 
its portfolios of derivatives with the respective counterparty based 
on observable market data (e.g. CDS spreads). In the case of funding 
valuation adjustments (FVAs), the funding costs or income of 
uncollateralised derivatives, as well as collateralised derivatives 
where there is only partial collateral or the collateral cannot be used 
for funding purposes, are recognised at fair value. Furthermore 
residual collateral funding costs/benefits, caused through collateral 
exchange under a credit support annex, are covered by ColVa 
(Collateral Valuation Adjustment). Like CVAs and DVAs, FVAs are also 
determined from the expected value of the future positive or 
negative portfolio fair values using observable market data (e.g. 
CDS spreads). The funding curve used to calculate the FVAs is 
approximated by the Commerzbank funding curve.

Sensitivity analysis 
 
Where the value of financial instruments is based on unobservable 
input parameters (level 3), the precise level of these parameters at 
the reporting date may be derived from a range of reasonable 
possible alternatives at the discretion of management. In preparing 
the Group financial statements, levels for these unobservable input 
parameters are chosen which are consistent with existing market 
evidence and in line with the Group’s valuation control approach. 
The purpose of this disclosure is to illustrate the potential impact 
of the relative uncertainty in the fair values of financial instruments 
with valuations based on unobservable input parameters (level 3). 
Interdependencies frequently exist between the parameters used to 
determine level 3 fair values. For example, an anticipated 
improvement in the overall economic situation may cause share 
prices to rise, while securities perceived as being lower risk, such 
as 
German 
Government 
Bonds, 
may 
lose 
value. 
Such 
interdependencies are accounted for by means of correlation 
parameters insofar as they have a significant effect on the fair values 
in question. If a valuation model uses several parameters, the choice 
of one parameter may restrict the range of possible values the other 
parameters may take. So, by definition, this category will contain 
more illiquid instruments, instruments with longer-term maturities 
and instruments where sufficient independent observable market 
data are difficult to obtain. The purpose of this information is to 
illustrate the main unobservable input parameters for level 3 
financial instruments and subsequently present various inputs on 
which the key input parameters were based. 
The main unobservable input parameters for level 3 and the key 
related factors may be summarised as follows: 
• Internal rate of return (IRR): 
The IRR is defined as the discount rate that sets the net present 
value of all future cash flows from an instrument equal to zero. 
For bonds, for example, the IRR depends on the current bond 
price, the nominal value and the duration. 
• Credit spread: 
The credit spread is the yield spread (premium or discount) 
between securities that are identical in all respects except for 
their respective credit quality. The credit spread represents the 
excess yield above the benchmark reference instrument that 
compensates for the difference in creditworthiness between the 
instrument and the benchmark. Credit spreads are quoted in 
terms of the number of basis points above (or below) the quoted 
benchmark. The wider (higher) the credit spread in relation to 
the benchmark, the lower the instrument’s creditworthiness, and 
vice versa for narrower (lower) credit spreads. 
• Interest rate-forex (IR-FX) correlation: 
The IR-FX correlation is relevant for the pricing of exotic interest 
rate swaps involving the exchange of funding instruments in one 
currency and an exotic structured leg that is usually based on 
the development of two government bond yields in different 
currencies. Consensus market data for longer durations are not 
observable for certain exotic interest products. For example, 
Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT)-yields for US government 
bonds with a duration of more than ten years are not observable. 
• Recovery rates, survival and default probabilities: 
Supply and demand as well as the arbitrage relationship with 
asset swaps tend to be the dominant factors driving pricing of 
credit default swaps (CDS). Models for pricing credit default 
swaps tend to be used more for exotic structures and off-market 
default swap valuation for which fixed interest payments above 
or below the market rate are agreed. These models calculate the 
implied default probability of the reference asset as a means of 
discounting the cash flows expected in a credit default swap. The 
model inputs are credit spreads and recovery rates that are used 
to interpolate (“bootstrap”) a time series of survival probabilities 
of the reference asset. A typical recovery rate assumption in the 
default swap market for senior unsecured contracts is 40 %. 
Assumptions about recovery rates are a factor determining the 
shape of the survival probability curve. Different recovery rate 
assumptions translate into different survival probability rates. 
For a given credit spread, a high recovery rate assumption 
implies a higher probability of default (relative to a low recovery 
rate assumption) and hence a lower survival probability. There 
is a relationship over time between default rates and recovery 
rates of corporate bond issuers. The correlation between the two 
is an inverse one: an increase in the default rate (defined as the 
percentage of issuers defaulting) is generally associated with a 
decline in the average recovery rate. In practice, market 
participants use market spreads to determine implied default 
probabilities. Estimates of default probabilities also depend on 
the joint loss distributions of the parties involved in a credit 
derivative transaction. The copula function is used to measure 
the correlation structure between two or more variables. The 
copula function creates a joint distribution while keeping the 
characteristics of the two independent marginal distributions.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
• Repo curve: 
The repo curve parameter is an input parameter that is relevant 
for the pricing of repurchase agreements (repos). Generally, 
these are short dated maturities ranging from O/N up to 
12 months. Beyond 12-month maturities the repo curve 
parameter may become unobservable, particularly for emerging 
market underlyings, due to the lack of available independent 
observable market data. In some cases, proxy repo curves may 
be used to estimate the repo curve input parameter. Where this 
is deemed insufficient, the input parameter will be classified as 
unobservable. Furthermore, mutual fund related repos may also 
contain unobservable repo curve exposures. 
• Price: 
Certain interest rate and loan instruments are accounted for on 
the basis of their price. It follows that the price itself is the 
unobservable parameter of which the sensitivity is estimated as 
a deviation in the net present value of the positions. 
• Inflation volatility: 
Inflation volatility represents the degree of fluctuation in 
financial instruments that transfer inflation risk between parties. 
This is based on a historical time series of cash flows, linked to 
the inflation trend. 
• Correlation between shares and FX rates: 
Correlation is a parameter that measures the movements 
between two instruments. It is measured by a correlation 
coefficient. In this specific case, the parameter refers to the 
Equity-FX quanto correlation. 
• Mean reversion: 
Mean reversion represents the long-term trend of prices and 
returns towards a mean price or average. This long-term average 
may be either a historical average of a price or yield or some 
other relevant average.  
• Surrender rate: 
The surrender rate refers to the percentage of policyholders who 
terminate their life insurance policies before their regular expiry 
dates and receive a portion of the premiums paid. 
• Lapse rate: 
The lapse rate refers to the percentage of policyholders who let 
their cover lapse through non-payment of premiums. In general, 
the lapse rate is higher for policies with higher premiums, longer 
durations and lower accumulation of net present value.

The selected parameters lie at the extremes of their range of 
reasonable possible alternatives. In practice, however, it is unlikely 
that all unobservable parameters would simultaneously lie at the 
extremes of their range of reasonable possible alternatives. 
Consequently, the estimates provided are likely to exceed the actual 
uncertainty in the fair values of these instruments. The purpose of 
these figures is not to estimate or predict future changes in fair 
value. The unobservable parameters were either shifted by between 
1% and 10% as deemed appropriate by our independent valuation 
experts for each type of instrument or a measure of standard 
deviation was applied.

Day one profit or loss 
 
The Commerzbank Group has entered into transactions where the 
fair value was calculated using a valuation model, where not all 
material input parameters were observable in the market. The initial 
carrying value of such transactions is the fair value. The difference 
between the transaction price and the fair value under the model is 
termed the “day one profit or loss”. The day one profit or loss is 
basically not recognised immediately in the income statement but 
over the term of the transaction. As soon as there is a quoted market 
price on an active market for such transactions or all material input 
parameters become observable, the accrued day one profit or loss 
is immediately recognised in the income statement in the net 
income from financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
through profit or loss. A cumulated difference between the 
transaction price and fair value determined by the model is 
calculated for the level 3 items in all categories. Material impacts 
result only from financial instruments of the HFT category.

b) Financial instruments measured at amortised cost 
 
IFRS 7 additionally requires disclosure of the fair values for 
financial instruments not recognised in the balance sheet at fair 
value. The measurement methodology to determine fair value in 
these cases is explained below. 
The nominal value of financial instruments that fall due on a daily 
basis is taken as their fair value.  
Market prices are not available for loans. In the case of loans, 
the Bank therefore applies a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. 
The cash flows are discounted using a risk-free interest rate plus 
premiums for risk costs, refinancing costs, operating expenses and 
equity costs. The risk-free interest rate is determined based on swap 
rates (swap curves) that match the corresponding maturities and 
currencies. These can usually be derived from external data. 
In addition, the Bank applies a premium in the form of a 
calibration constant that includes a profit margin. The profit margin 
is reflected in the model valuation of loans such that fair value as at 
the initial recognition date corresponds to the disbursement amount. 
Data on the credit risk costs of major banks and corporate 
customers are available in the form of credit spreads. 
In the case of securities accounted for in the amortised cost 
category of IFRS 9, fair value is determined based on available 
market prices (level 1), assuming an active market exists. If there is 
no active market, recognised valuation methods are to be used to 
determine the fair values. In general, an asset swap pricing model 
is used for the valuation. The parameters applied comprise yield 
curves and the asset swap spreads of comparable benchmark 
instruments. 
For deposits, a DCF model is generally used for determining fair 
value, since market data are usually not available. In addition to the 
yield curve, own credit spread and a premium for operating 
expenses are also taken into account. Credit spreads of the 
respective counterparties are not used in the measurement of 
liabilities.  
The fair value of debt securities issued is determined on the 
basis of available market prices. If no prices are available, the 
discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to determine the fair 
values. A number of different factors, including current market 
interest rates and own credit spread, are taken into account in 
determining fair value.  
With respect to each of the explanations provided above, if 
available market prices are applied, they are to be classified as 
level 1. Otherwise, classification is made at level 2 or level 3, 
depending on the input parameters used (observable or not 
observable).

(36) Information on netting of financial instruments 
 
Below we present the reconciliation of gross amounts before netting 
to net amounts after netting, as well as the amounts for existing 
netting rights that do not meet the accounting criteria for netting – 
separately for all financial assets and liabilities carried on the 
balance sheet that 
• are already netted in accordance with IAS 32.42 (financial 
instruments I), and are 
• subject to an enforceable, bilateral master netting agreement or 
a similar agreement but are not netted in the balance sheet 
(financial instruments II). 
 
For the netting agreements, we conclude master agreements 
with our counterparties, e.g. 1992 ISDA Master Agreement 
(Multicurrency – Cross Border) and German Master Agreement for 
Financial Futures. By means of such netting agreements, the 
positive and negative fair values of the derivatives contracts 
included under a master agreement can be offset against one 
another. This netting process reduces the credit risk to a single net 
claim on the party to the contract (close-out netting). However, 
these netting agreements do not permit netting in the balance sheet 
in accordance with IAS 32.42 as there is no ongoing settlement on 
a net basis of the contracts that fall under the respective master 
agreements. Furthermore, collateral for transactions that fall under 
a master agreement can only be realised if the counterparty defaults 
within the context of close-out netting. 
We apply netting to receivables and liabilities from genuine 
repurchase agreements (reverse repos and repos) of the categories 
Amortised Cost, Mandatorily Fair Value P&L and Fair Value Option 
with central and bilateral counterparties, provided they have the 
same term. OTC derivatives with customers and cleared own 
portfolios are likewise netted.

(37) Maturities of assets and liabilities (including financial obligations) 
 
The table below lists all assets and liabilities (except for positive and 
negative fair values of derivative hedging instruments) classified by 
whether they are short-term or long-term. The residual term or the 
time of anticipated realisation or fulfilment is defined as short-term 
if the period between the reporting date and the instrument’s 
maturity date is less than one year. Financial instruments without 
contractual maturities, cash on hand and cash on demand, assets 
and liabilities held for sale and current taxes on income are 
classified as short-term items. By contrast, holdings in companies 
accounted for using the equity method, intangible assets, fixed 
assets, investment properties and deferred taxes are generally 
classified as long-term items. When classifying other assets and 
other liabilities we make an assessment for the main items. For 
information on how the maturities of the main types of provisions 
are classified, please refer to Note 54.

In the maturity breakdown, we show the residual terms of non-
derivative financial obligations that are subject to contractual 
maturities. The values are presented based on undiscounted cash 
flows. As a result, a reconciliation with the values in the balance 
sheet is not possible. Derivative obligations – held for trading are 
reported in the shortest maturity range. Negative fair values of 
derivative hedging instruments are reported on the basis of their 
fair values in the relevant maturity range. The residual term is 
defined as the period between the reporting date and the 
contractual maturity date of the financial instruments. We present 
information on the management of liquidity risks Group risk report

(38) Transferred financial assets and collateral pledged for own liabilities 
 
Repo transactions combine the spot purchase or sale of securities 
with their forward sale or repurchase, the counterparty being 
identical in both cases. The securities sold under repurchase 
agreements (spot sale) continue to be recognised and measured in 
the Group balance sheet as part of the securities portfolio in 
accordance with the category to which they are assigned. The 
securities are not derecognised as we retain all risks and 
opportunities connected with the ownership of the security sold 
under the repurchase agreement. The same risks and opportunities 
that apply to non-transferred financial assets thus also apply to 
financial assets that have been transferred but not derecognised. 
We conduct securities lending transactions with other banks and 
customers in order to meet delivery commitments or to enable us 
to effect securities repurchase agreements. We report these 
transactions in a similar manner to securities repurchase 
transactions. Securities lent remain in our securities portfolio and 
are measured and categorised according to the rules of IFRS 9. 
Borrowed securities do not appear in the balance sheet, nor are they 
valued. In securities lending transactions, the counterparty credit 
risk can be avoided by obtaining collateral, which may be provided 
in the form of cash, for example. Collateral furnished for a lending 
transaction is referred to as “cash collateral out” and collateral 
received as “cash collateral in”. In addition, cash collateral is 
deposited or received in connection with derivative transactions.

Derivatives and hedging relationships  
(41) Derivatives 
 
A derivative is a financial instrument with a value determined by an 
“underlying asset”. The underlying asset may, for example, be an 
interest rate, commodity price, share price, foreign exchange rate 
or bond price. The financial instrument does not require any initial 
net investment or an initial investment that is smaller than would be 
required for other types of instrument expected to have a similar 
response to changes in market factors. It is settled at a future date. 
Most of the derivatives transactions involve OTC derivatives, 
with a nominal amount, maturity and price which are agreed 
individually between the Bank and its counterparties. However, the 
Bank also concludes derivatives contracts on regulated stock 
exchanges. These are standardised contracts with standardised 
nominal amounts and settlement dates. 
The nominal amount shows the volume traded by the Bank. The 
positive and negative fair values, however, are the expenses which 
would be incurred by the Bank or the counterparties to replace the 
contracts originally concluded with transactions of an equivalent 
financial value. From the Bank’s point of view, a positive fair value 
thus indicates the maximum potential counterparty-specific default 
risk present from derivative transactions on the reporting date. 
In order to minimise both the economic and regulatory credit 
risk arising from these instruments, we conclude master 
agreements (bilateral netting agreements) with our counterparties 
(such as 1992 ISDA Master Agreement Multi-Currency Cross-
Border; German Master Agreement for Financial Futures). By 
means of such bilateral netting agreements, the positive and 
negative fair values of the derivatives contracts included under a 
master agreement can be offset against one another, and the future 
regulatory risk add-ons for these products can be reduced. This 
netting process reduces the credit risk to a single net claim on the 
party to the contract (close-out netting). 
For both regulatory reports and the internal measurement and 
monitoring of our credit commitments, we use such risk-mitigating 
techniques only where we consider them enforceable in the 
jurisdiction in question if the counterparty should become insolvent. 
We obtain legal opinions from various international law firms in 
order to verify enforceability. 
Similar to the master agreements are the collateral agreements 
(e.g. collateralisation annex for financial futures contracts, Credit 
Support Annex), which we conclude with our business partners to 
secure the net claim or liability remaining after netting (receiving 
or furnishing of collateral). As a rule, this collateral management 
reduces credit risk by means of prompt – usually daily or weekly – 
measurement and adjustment of the customer exposure. 
The aforementioned netting agreements do not meet the 
offsetting requirements according to IAS 32.42, as close-out netting 
is contingent upon default by the counterparty. Ongoing net 
settlement is therefore not contractually intended for bilaterally 
agreed derivatives. 
The overall effect of the balance sheet offsetting of cleared OTC 
derivatives with customers and derivatives in the Bank’s own 
portfolio as at 31 December 2023 totalled to €117,505m as of 
31 December 2023 (previous year: €143,376m). On the assets side, 
€110,369m of this was attributable to positive fair values (previous 
year: €131,387m), and to claims for variation margins €7,136m 
(previous year: €11,990m). Netting on the liabilities side involved 
negative fair values of €109,079m (previous year: €131,250m) and 
liabilities for variation margins payable of €8,426m (previous year: 
€12,127m). 
As at the reporting date, the outstanding volume of 
Commerzbank Group’s transactions as a protection buyer and seller 
amounted to €10,037m (previous year: €11,967m) and €6,003m 
(previous year: €7,742m). We employ these products, which are 
used to transfer credit risk, both for arbitrage purposes in trading 
and in the banking book for diversifying our loan portfolios.

(42) Hedging relationships 
 
Commerzbank applies hedge accounting in accordance with the 
provisions of IFRS 9. IAS 39 continues to apply to the fair value 
hedge accounting portfolio for interest rate risks, as there are 
currently no mandatory requirements from the “Dynamic Risk 
Management” IASB project. IAS 39 and IFRS 9 contain extensive 
hedge accounting regulations which apply if it can be shown that 
the hedging instruments – especially derivatives – are employed to 
hedge risks in the underlying non-trading transactions. Three types 
of hedge accounting are used: 
•  Fair value hedge accounting: 
IAS 39 and IFRS 9 prescribe the use of hedge accounting to 
avoid a distorted impact on earnings for derivatives which serve 
to hedge financial instruments of the valuation categories AC 
(Amortised Cost) and FVOCI (Fair Value through Other 
Comprehensive Income) against one or more defined risks. The 
Group’s issuing and lending business and the securities holdings 
for liquidity management as well as investment portfolio are 
particularly subject to interest rate risk when fixed-income 
securities are involved. Interest rate swaps are primarily used to 
hedge these risks. Use is also made of swaptions, inflation swaps, 
forwards and, to a limited extent, of other structured derivatives. 
The derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes 
are recognised in the income statement at fair value as fair 
values of derivative hedging instruments. Any changes in the fair 
value of the hedged asset or hedged liability resulting from an 
opposite move in the hedged risk are also recognised in the 
balance sheet. Offsetting changes on remeasurement associated 
with the hedging instruments and the hedged underlying 
transactions are recognised in the income statement as net 
income from hedge accounting. Any portion of the changes in 
fair value of the hedged underlying transactions that are not 
attributable to the hedged risk is accounted for in accordance 
with the rules of the valuation category to which the hedged 
asset or liability belongs.  
For interest rate risks fair value hedge accounting can either be 
a micro fair value hedge or a portfolio fair value hedge. 
– In micro fair value hedge accounting an underlying 
transaction is linked with one or more hedging transactions in 
a hedging relationship. The carrying amounts of the hedged 
transactions are adjusted through profit or loss in the event of 
changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. 
– In a portfolio fair value hedge, interest rate risks are hedged 
at the portfolio level. It is not individual transactions or 
groups of transactions with a similar risk structure that are 
hedged, but, rather, a quantity of underlying transactions in 
a portfolio grouped by maturity bands in accordance with the 
expected repayment and interest adjustment dates. Portfolios 
may contain only assets, only liabilities, or a mixture of both. 
In this type of hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of 
the underlying transactions are reported in the balance sheet 
as a separate asset or liability item.  
• Cash flow hedge accounting: 
The use of cash flow hedge accounting also serves to avoid a 
distorted impact on profit or loss for derivatives which serve to 
hedge the risk of a change in future cash flows of hedged 
underlying transactions. Interest rate swaps are primarily used 
to hedge these cash flows. Derivatives used in cash flow hedge 
accounting are measured at fair value. The effective portion of 
gains and losses are recognised net of deferred taxes in the cash 
flow hedge reserve under equity. The ineffective portion, on the 
other hand, is reported in the income statement in net income 
from hedge accounting. The general accounting rules set out 
above for the underlying transactions of the hedged cash flows 
remain unchanged by this. 
• Net investment hedge accounting: 
By applying net investment hedge accounting, effects on profit 
or loss from foreign currency hedging transactions are avoided 
to the extent that they serve to hedge a net investment in a 
foreign currency.  
 
The application of hedge accounting rules is tied to a number of 
conditions. These relate above all to the documentation of the 
hedging relationship and also to its effectiveness. 
The hedge must be documented in accordance with IFRS 39 
IFRS 9 at inception. Documentation must include in particular the 
identification of the hedging instrument, the related hedged item or 
transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how 
effectiveness of the hedge is assessed. Besides the documentation, 
IAS 39 / IFRS 9 also require evidence of an effective hedge for the 
entire period of the hedging relationship in order to apply hedge 
accounting rules. Effectiveness in this context means the 
relationship between the change in fair value or cash flow of the 
hedged item and the offsetting change in fair value or cash flow of

the hedging instrument. If these changes offset each other almost 
fully, a high degree of effectiveness exists. Proof of effectiveness 
requires that a high degree of effectiveness can be expected from a 
hedge in the future (prospective effectiveness). To continue 
portfolio hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39, it must also 
be demonstrated that the hedging relationship was highly effective 
during the reporting period (retrospective effectiveness). The 
effectiveness in accordance with IAS 39 must be within a range of 
0.8 to 1.25 both prospectively and retrospectively. 
Commerzbank’s fair value hedge accounting includes hedges 
against interest rate risk, inflation risk and full fair value risk. 
Interest rate risks arise from the fact that asset and liability 
portfolios consist of variable and fixed cash flows that lead to 
fluctuating net interest income in the event of interest rate changes. 
At Commerzbank, this relates to commercial business as well as 
liquidity, investment and issuing portfolios. 
Interest rate risk is managed centrally by the Treasury function 
of Commerzbank based on an aggregated net interest rate risk 
position. For this purpose, it is transferred daily to Treasury using 
an internal interest transfer price. Other components of fair value, 
such as credit spread or margin and liquidity components, are not 
included in the internal interest transfer price. The Treasury 
function performs its interest rate risk hedging mainly via a risk 
transfer to central swap trading with the Corporate Clients segment, 
where the bundled risks are closed by external transactions or are 
retained subject to limits. 
For certain holdings in the investment portfolio, inflation risk 
hedging or full fair value hedging is also carried out.  
Commerzbank applies micro fair value hedge accounting (MFVH) 
when Treasury also hedges the interest rate risk, inflation risk or full 
fair value risk economically at the micro level. Hedges in the IFRS 
micro fair value hedging relationships are generally based on 
economic hedge accounting. Portfolio fair value hedge accounting 
(PFVH) is used for the remaining interest rate risk position. For this 
purpose, external derivatives are selected based on their net risk 
position (NRP), and their changes in fair value are compared with 
the changes in fair value of the allocated hedged items – likewise 
based on their NRP. 
In hedge accounting for interest rate risk hedges, the benchmark 
for the risk to be hedged for Euro-positions (3M Euribor curve). 
Positions in the currencies US-Dollar (USD), British pound (GBP), 
Swiss franc (CHF) and Japanese yen (JPY) were switched to the 
relevant overnight index swaps (OIS) rate as part of the IBOR reform. 
For micro fair value hedge accounting, a fair value based on interest 
rate risk is determined, and the future interest and nominal 
payments are discounted using the defined interest rate curve. In 
portfolio fair value hedge accounting, the future cash flows for the 
commercial transaction are derived from the internal interest 
transfer price and also discounted using the defined yield curve. 
Commerzbank’s portfolio fair value hedge accounting is closely 
aligned to economic interest rate risk management. The underlying 
transactions to be hedged mainly derive from the Bank’s 
commercial business and form a dynamic portfolio which changes 
continuously in the individual maturity bands as a result of new 
business or the shift of the overall portfolio into shorter maturity 
bands. The derivative net risk position generates either payer or 
recipient positions for each maturity band, to which assets or 
liabilities in the respective maturity bands are allocated. The 
portfolio hedge relationships are usually designated for a two-week 
period. They are then closed down and a redesignation is made 
based on the changed overall portfolio. 
Commerzbank uses the statistical method of regression analysis 
to assess effectiveness in micro fair value hedge accounting. The 
changes in fair value of the underlying transaction and the hedging 
instrument are determined by means of historical simulations for 
the prospective effectiveness test. Regression analysis is also used 
for the prospective effectiveness test in portfolio fair value hedge 
accounting, while the dollar-offset method is used for the 
retrospective effectiveness test. 
Within Commerzbank’s micro and portfolio fair value hedge 
accounting, the causes of ineffective hedging lie primarily in the 
risk contained in the measurement of the fair value of the hedging 
instruments – mainly interest rate swaps – which cannot be used in 
determining the fair value of the hedged item. As a result, the 
changes in the fair value of the respective hedging instrument are 
not fully offset by the changes in the fair value of the hedged item. 
The most significant risk in this context is the basis risk, in 
particular the tenor basis risk. 
Commerzbank holds a portfolio of inflation-linked bonds issued 
by utility companies under the UK private finance initiative (PFI), 
for which risk management focuses on changes in fair value 
resulting from fluctuations in GBP interest rates and implicit 
inflation expectations of the UK Retail Price Index (UK RPI). Risk 
management is based on the use of a portfolio of simple fixed-for-
float GBP interest rate swaps and simple zero coupon inflation 
swaps, settled in each case generally through the London Clearing 
House. The primary sensitivity of zero coupon inflation swaps 
relates to fluctuations in UK RPI swap rates, and they are used to 
hedge changes in the value of the inflation-linked bonds resulting 
from fluctuations in inflation expectations. Each inflation swap has 
only one cash flow at maturity. As inflation expectations move up or 
down, the expected cash flows at maturity will rise or fall to offset 
changes in the value of the inflation-linked bonds. The interest rate 
swaps are used to hedge the sensitivity of the inflation-linked bonds 
to interest rate risk, with payment dates generally matching those of 
the inflation-linked bonds during the term.

Commerzbank also applies cash flow hedge accounting. On the 
one hand, this includes derivatives used to swap the variable cash 
flows from a group of similar mortgage loans into fixed cash flows. 
On the other hand, cash flow hedge accounting is applied for cross 
currency swaps that were concluded to hedge the cash flows of 
floating-rate mortgage bonds. The prospective and retrospective 
effectiveness test is based on linear regression. The fair value 
changes of the hedged transactions are determined using the 
“hypothetical derivative” method. Ineffectiveness mainly arises from 
fair value adjustments (credit and debit valuation adjustments) which 
are taken into account only in the hedging transaction. 
Commerzbank also applies net investment hedge accounting to 
avoid currency effects from shipping company investments. The 
effective portion of the net remeasurement gain or loss is 
recognised directly in equity in the currency reserve after taking 
deferred taxes into account.

The investments in companies accounted for using the equity 
method are non-strategic holdings of Commerzbank Group, which 
are active mainly in the financial services sector and in leasing and 
real estate business.  
The disclosures in this Note are made on an aggregated basis, for 
the associated companies and for the joint ventures. A list of all 
companies accounted for using the equity method is given in Note 69. 
In the 2023 financial year €11m (previous year: €18m) in 
dividends from associated companies accounted for using the 
equity method was paid. As in the previous year, no dividends were 
paid directly or indirectly to Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft by 
joint ventures accounted for using the equity method.  
Where obligations arise from contingent liabilities of companies 
accounted for using the equity method or discontinued operations 
at 
companies 
accounted 
for 
using 
the 
equity 
method, 
Commerzbank Group is liable to the extent of its respective 
ownership interest.

Intangible assets
(44) Other intangible assets 
 
Other intangible assets primarily comprise purchased and self-
programmed software and customer relationships. When assessing 
whether to recognise the development costs of in-house developed 
software as an intangible asset, the main criteria applied are the 
ability to reliably determine the manufacturing costs and the 
probability of the future flow of benefits. Research costs are not 
recognised as an asset. Intangible assets are reported at amortised 
cost. Due to their finite useful economic lives, software and 
customer relationships are amortised on a straight-line basis over 
their prospective useful lives.

Tangible assets 
(45) Fixed assets 
 
The asstes reported in the fixed assets position are recognised at 
cost less scheduled depreciation and any unscheduled write-downs. 
Impairments are made in an amount by which the carrying value 
exceeds the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use of 
the asset. Where the reason for recognising an impairment in 
previous financial years ceases to apply, the impairment is reversed 
to no more than depreciated cost.In determining the useful life, the 
likely physical wear and tear, technical obsolescence and legal and 
contractual restrictions are taken into consideration. All fixed assets 
are depreciated largely over the following periods, using the 
straight-line method

In line with the materiality principle, purchases of low-value fixed 
assets are recognised immediately as operating expenses. Profits 
realised on the disposal of fixed assets appear under other income, 
with losses being shown under other expenses.

The total value of fixed assets in Commerzbank Group was €2,352m 
(previous year: €2,426m) of which, as in the previous year, none 
was pledged as collateral. Beyond this there were no restrictions 
with regard to rights of disposal.  
Implementation of “Strategy 2024” involved the closing of 
further branches in Germany from 2021 to 2023 and of international 
locations, as well as giving up properties (rights of use), especially 
at the Frankfurt/Main location. This leads in part to a shorter 
remaining useful life of the right of use assets and the office 
furniture and equipment and thus to increased depreciation, which 
mainly affected the 2021 and 2022 financial years. This represented 
a change in the estimate of the useful life of depreciable assets, with 
an impact of €8m (previous year: €47m). The increased 
depreciation from the restructuring measures is reported under 
restructuring expenses (see Note 20).

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
(46) Investment properties 
 
Investment properties are defined as land and buildings held for the 
purpose of earning rental income or because they are expected to 
increase in value. Commerzbank Group also reports properties 
acquired as a result of the realisation of collateral (rescue purchases) 
and properties owned by Commerzbank Group that are let under 
operating leases in this category. These are primarily commercial 
properties. 
Investment properties are measured at cost including directly 
attributable transaction costs on initial recognition in accordance 
with IAS 40. If a property is transferred from fixed assets to 
investment properties due to a change in use, it is booked at fair 
value on the initial recognition date. In subsequent measurements, 
investment properties are measured at fair value. The fair value is 
determined based on valuations conducted by independent and 
qualified experts based on current market values. Properties used 
for commercial purposes are usually valued based on capitalised 
income; individual residential buildings are generally valued using 
the cost or sales comparison approach. The valuation of the 
properties using the capitalised income approach is based on 
standard rental values for the locality, with discounts for 
management, acquisition costs and vacancy rates, and on 
remaining useful lives and land values. In some cases, contractually 
agreed rents are also used. The property yield, which is a further 
input in the valuation process, takes account of the market interest 
rate level and the specific property and location risk attaching to the 
property. The main parameters observable on the market are local 
rent levels and property yields. 
Current income and expenses are recognised in other net 
income. Remeasurement changes arising from changes in fair value 
are also shown under other net income in the income statement for 
the period. 
The properties held as investments in the amount of €53m 
(previous year: €57m) were classified at fair value hierarchy level 3 
and developed as follows:

In the year under review, as in the previous year, no investment 
properties were acquired in rescue purchases. In the 2022 financial 
year, one property was transferred from fixed assets to investment 
properties due to a change in use. 
There are no restrictions on resale, nor are there any obligations 
to purchase properties that need to be reported here. 
We use the country-specific rental indices for commercial and 
office properties published by the Association of German Pfandbrief 
Banks (vdp) over a period of at least 18 years for the sensitivity 
analysis of investment properties. We use the medium fluctuation 
range calculated on this basis to determine the potential changes in 
value of our properties.

Non-current assets and liabilities held for sale 
 
(47) Non-current assets held for sale  
Non-current assets that can be sold in their present condition and 
whose sale is highly probable are classified as “held for sale”. These 
assets must be measured at fair value less costs to sell, insofar as 
this is lower than carrying amount. However, for interest-bearing 
and non-interest-bearing financial instruments and investment 
properties the only accounting change is the reclassification to the 
relevant balance sheet items in accordance with IFRS 5. They 
continue to be measured in accordance with IFRS 9 or IAS 40.  
If impairments are established as a result of measurement in 
accordance with IFRS 5, these are recognised in the corresponding 
position in the income statement, depending on the underlying 
transaction. Any subsequent write-up is limited to the total of 
impairments previously recognised. 
The current net income from non-current assets held for sale is 
normally recognised under the same item in the income statement 
as for other assets without the classification of being held for sale.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Tax assets and tax liabilities  
Current tax assets and liabilities are calculated on the basis of the 
expected payment to or rebate from each fiscal authority given the 
current tax rates and tax regulations applicable in the relevant 
country. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are formed to reflect 
differences between the IFRS carrying amounts of assets or 
liabilities and the taxable value, provided that these temporary 
differences are likely to increase or reduce future taxes on income 
and there is no rule against recognising them. In addition, deferred 
taxes are recognised for both tax loss carryforwards as well as for 
as yet unused tax credits. The valuation of deferred taxes is based 
on income tax rates already approved as at 31 December 2023 and 
applicable upon realisation of the temporary differences. 
Deferred tax assets on tax-relieving temporary differences, on as 
yet unused tax losses and on unused tax credits are only recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be generated 
by the same taxable entity and in relation to the same tax authority 
in the foreseeable future. To assess impairment, detailed 5-year tax 
profit projections are made on the basis of the multi-year planning 
approved by the Board of Managing Directors. Furthermore, 
recognition is justified if it is likely that a sufficient taxable profit 
will be available even beyond the 5-year time frame. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised and carried 
forward either in the income statement under taxes on income, or 
in equity, depending on the treatment of the underlying transaction. 
Income tax expenses or income are reported under taxes on 
income in the Group income statement.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted if there is a right to 
net current taxes on income and the deferred tax assets and 
liabilities relate to taxes on income levied by the same fiscal 
authority on the same taxable entity. 
Taxable 
temporary 
differences

to

Commerzbank Group companies for which no significant deferred 
income tax liabilities were recognised amounted to €501m

Provisions for taxes on income are potential tax liabilities which 
have not yet been formally assessed and potential liabilities for risks 
associated with tax audits. The liabilities to tax authorities represent 
payment obligations in respect of current taxes towards German 
and foreign tax authorities.  
Deferred tax liabilities represent the potential income tax charge 
arising from temporary differences between the values assigned to 
assets and liabilities in the Group balance sheet in accordance with 
IFRS and their values for tax accounting purposes as reported by 
the Group companies in accordance with the local tax regulations.

Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft has given an undertaking to 
the Polish Financial Supervision Authority that it will provide its 
affiliated companies mBank S.A., Warsaw and mBank Hipoteczny 
S.A., Warsaw with sufficient liquidity and capital to ensure that they 
are in a position to meet their financial obligations at all times.

Leasing 
(53) Leasing 
 
The Group as lessee – rights of use 
With the application of IFRS 16, a right-of-use asset and a 
corresponding lease liability are now recognised for leases. We 
recognise the right of use under fixed assets (see Note 45) and 
depreciate it on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The 
depreciation of the right of use is shown in the operating expenses 
(see Note 18). Extension, termination and purchase options are 
recognised as soon as their exercise is deemed sufficiently certain. 
Around half of the leases include such options, mainly extension 
options. This relates primarily to extension options. The 
Commerzbank Group does not expect any significant cash outflows 
in the future which have not been taken into account in measuring 
the lease liability. 
The lease liability is recognised at the net present value of the 
future lease payments to be made under other liabilities (see 
Note 51). Interest expense includes the unwinding of the discount 
of the lease liabilities. Subsequent measurement is performed using 
the effective interest method. We make use of the option to exclude 
low-value leases from accounting and recognise them directly as 
expenses.  
In 2023, expenses for low-value leases were €3m (previous year: 
€2m). Variable lease payments (as in the previous year) of €0m 
were not included in lease liabilities, and income of €16m (previous 
year: €16m) from sub-lease agreements was recorded in the period 
under review. Total lease payments amounted to €315m (previous 
year: €333m ). 
The Group as lessor 
We classify a lease as an operating lease if it does not substantially 
transfer to the lessee all the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership. By contrast, we classify leases where the lessee bears 
all the substantial risks and rewards as finance leases. Risks and 
rewards are allocated on the basis of the present value of the cash 
flow associated with the leases. 
If the present value equals at least the amount invested into the 
leased asset, the lease is classified as a finance lease. 
 
Operating leases 
Commerzbank acts as a lessor in operating lease arrangements. The 
assets where the Group acts as lessor include, in particular, 
technical equipment and machines, real estate and office furniture 
and equipment (e.g. vehicles, machinery and equipment). No 
contingent rents have been agreed in the leases. 
The following minimum lease payments stemming from non-
cancellable leases will accrue to Commerzbank Group over the next 
few years from operating leases granted:

Lessor disclosures – finance leases 
Commerzbank acts as a lessor for finance leases. As at the reporting 
date, these leases primarily comprised technical equipment and 
machines, office furniture and equipment (e.g. vehicles and office 
equipment) and to a lesser extent leased real estate. The 
relationship between gross investments and net present value of the 
minimum lease payments was as follows:

The minimum lease payments include the total lease instalments to 
be paid by the lessee under the lease plus the guaranteed residual 
value. The non-guaranteed residual value is estimated at the 
beginning of the lease and reviewed at the reporting date on a 
regular basis. Unrealised financial income is equivalent to the 
interest implicit in the lease between the reporting date and the end 
of the contract.

minimum lease payments from non-cancellable finance leases

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Provisions and employee benefits 
A provision must be shown if on the reporting date, as the result of 
an event in the past, a current legal or constructive obligation has 
arisen, an outflow of resources to meet this obligation is likely and 
it is possible to make a reliable estimate of the amount of this 
obligation. Accordingly, we make provisions for liabilities of an 
uncertain amount to third parties and anticipated losses arising 
from pending transactions in the amount of the claims expected. 
The amount recognised as a provision represents the best estimate 
of the expense required to meet the current obligation as at the 
reporting date. Risks and uncertainties (including with regard to the 
actual level of the costs at the date of any utilisation of the provision 
and potential increases in costs for long-term provisions) are taken 
into account in the estimate. Provisions are recognised at their net 
present value if they are long-term. 
Allocations to the different types of provisions are made via 
various items in the income statement. Provisions for lending 
business are charged to expenses for loan loss provisions and 
provisions for restructuring are charged to restructuring expenses. 
Other provisions are generally charged to operating expenses and 
released through other net income. 
Companies within the Commerzbank Group are involved both in 
Germany and other countries in court and arbitration cases (legal 
proceedings) and in out-of-court and supervisory proceedings 
(recourse claims) as defendants and claimants or in other ways. 
Moreover, legal cases in which Commerzbank and its subsidiaries 
are not directly involved could have an impact on the Group because 
of their fundamental importance for the banking sector. The Group 
recognises appropriate provisions for legal proceedings and 
recourse claims, with the charge shown in other net income, if a 
loss is likely and can be determined sufficiently accurately. 
Provisions 
of 
recourse 
claims 
relate, 
for 
example, 
to 
reimbursements of processing fees for consumer loans which have 
been ruled as invalid and possible claims from customer misselling. 
In the case of provisions for legal proceedings, the procedure differs 
depending on whether a company within the Group is the claimant 
(active proceedings) or defendant (passive proceedings). In active 
proceedings, provisions are recognised for the legal and court fees 
and ancillary costs, which may vary based on the specific practices 
in each country. In passive proceedings provisions are also 
recognised if the outflow of resources is probable. However, the 
Group’s final liability may differ from the provisions that have been 
recognised, as a high degree of judgement is involved in assessing 
the probability of uncertain liabilities in such legal proceedings and 
quantifying them. These estimates may turn out to be inaccurate at 
a later stage of the proceedings. Legal risks for which no provisions 
have been recognised are reported as contingent liabilities (see 
Note 56). 
Restructuring provisions are recognised if Commerzbank Group 
has a detailed formal restructuring plan and has already begun 
implementing this plan or has announced the main details of the 
restructuring. The detailed plan must contain information on the 
departments and main locations involved, the approximate number 
of staff whose jobs are affected by the restructuring, the costs 
involved and the period during which the restructuring will be 
carried out. The detailed plan must be communicated in such a way 
that those affected can expect it to be realised. The restructuring 
expenses item in the income statement can contain further direct 
restructuring expenses which are not included in the restructuring 
provision. 
Provisions for pensions and similar commitments are recognised 
for occupational pension schemes. These comprise pension 
commitments under both defined benefit and defined contribution 
pension plans. Defined benefit plans exist for obligations from 
pension entitlements and current benefits based on a direct pension 
commitment on the part of Commerzbank, where the level of the 
pension payment is mainly pre-defined and dependent on factors 
such as age, salary level and length of service. Provisions are 
established for these plans. The contributions paid for defined 
contribution pension plans are recognised directly under personnel 
expenses.

Provisions for pensions and similar commitments 
 
The provisions for pensions and similar commitments comprise 
provisions for pension entitlements of active and former employees, 
pension entitlements of pensioners in the amount of €54m 
(previous year: €52m), provisions for age-related part-time working 
schemes of €59m (previous year: €93m) and provisions for early 
retirement of €544m (previous year: €375m).

a) Defined benefit plans 
Pension obligations, pension-related obligations (age-related short-
time working schemes, early retirement), obligations for long-
service awards and pension expense for defined benefit plans are 
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected 
unit credit method. The underlying actuarial parameters are based 
on the norms in the country in which the pension plan was 
established. Apart from biometric assumptions (the Heubeck 
mortality tables 2018 G in Germany and country-specific biometric 
tables in other countries), the actuaries rely in particular on a 
current discount rate based on the yield on high-quality, long-term 
corporate bonds, as well as expected future rates of pension 
increases.  
The expected adjustments to pensions in Germany, which are 
generally based on German consumer price trends (inflation), were 
raised to 2.5% p.a. in 2023 (previous year: 2.4% p.a.). The rise in 
the expected adjustments to pensions resulted in a one-off negative 
effect of around €52m before taxes, which was recognised directly 
in equity. 
The future change in salaries does not have a material influence 
on the amount of the pension obligation due to the structure of the 
respective pension plans both in Germany and abroad. As a result, 
in line with the materiality principle, the parameter and its 
sensitivities are not disclosed.  
For German pension obligations, the discount factor is 
determined using a proprietary Commerzbank model based on  
AA-rated government bonds and adjusted by a spread between AA-
rated government bonds and AA-rated corporate bonds. 
The parameters outside Germany are determined on the basis of 
weighted averages taking account of the respective relevant 
pension plans.

For 
employees 
entitled 
to 
pension 
benefits 
who 
joined 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft or certain other consolidated 
companies before 31 December 2004, the pension entitlements are 
mainly based on the regulations of the Commerzbank modular plan 
for company pension benefits, known as the CBA. The amount of 
the benefits under CBA consists of an initial module for the period 
up to 31 December 2004, plus a benefit module – possibly 
augmented by a dynamic module – for each contributory year from 
2005 onwards; the benefits are structured as a lifelong pension with 
the option to take a lump sum. The use of the lump-sum option is 
considered in the actuarial valuation accordingly.  
Staff joining the Bank after 1 January 2005 have pension rights 
under the Commerzbank capital plan for company pension benefits, 
known as the CKA. The CKA guarantees a minimum benefit on the 
modular basis, but also offers additional opportunities for higher 
pension benefits through investing assets in investment funds. 
Since 1 January 2010 the direct pension arrangements for staff 
formerly employed by Dresdner Bank Aktiengesellschaft have also 
been based on the company pension modules (CBA). 
Furthermore, some foreign subsidiaries and branches, primarily 
in the United Kingdom and the USA, also have defined benefit plans. 
In addition to the occupational pension plans, there is an 
internally-financed healthcare plan in the United Kingdom which 
entitles members in retirement to reimbursement of medical costs. 
The resulting obligations are accounted for according to the rules 
for defined benefit pension plans as specified by IAS 19. 
In order to meet the direct pension liabilities in Germany, cover 
assets were transferred to a legally independent trustee, 
Commerzbank Pension Trust e. V. (CPT), under a Contractual Trust 
Arrangement (CTA). The assets held by CPT and the cover assets 
for pension obligations in our foreign units qualify as plan assets 
within the definition of IAS 19.8. The trust agreements signed by 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and other Group companies in 
Germany with the CPT also provide insolvency insurance for the 
direct occupational pension commitments funded by plan assets. 
The insolvency insurance covers all vested benefits of active and 
former employees and all current benefits being paid to pensioners. 
It covers the portion of vested or current benefits that are not 
covered by Pensions-Sicherungs-Verein (PSV), the German 
pensions insurance fund. The trust agreements do not require the 
trustor companies to pay in contributions. However, the plan assets 
must cover the liabilities not covered by PSV at all times. The 
companies that are party to the agreements may only request 
rebates from the plan assets for pension benefits that have been 
paid up to this limit.  
The investment guidelines for the German plan assets are laid 
down jointly by the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft and the CPT. There are no legal requirements for 
the investment guidelines. The investment management is carried 
out by the Executive Pension Committee (EPC), which follows a 
liability-driven investment (LDI) approach as part of its Asset 
Liability Management. It also sets the framework for determining 
the actuarial assumptions. The main aim of the investment strategy 
is to replicate the future cash flows for the pension liabilities using 
derivatives for interest rates, inflation and credit spreads, with the 
aim of reducing the risks directly attributable to the future 
development of the pension liabilities. Apart from the usual pension 
risks such as inflation and biometric risks there are no other unusual 
risks at Commerzbank. The portfolio of the plan assets is well-
diversified and mainly comprises fixed-income securities, equities 
and alternative investments. 
The pension plans outside Germany have their own trust 
structures independent from the CPT. Overall, they currently 
represent around 4% of the Group’s total pension liabilities. The 
EPC also acts as the steering committee for the plan assets of the 
foreign pension plans. Different national regulations also apply in 
each of the foreign countries. However, these plans also generally 
use an LDI approach. The biggest plan sponsors outside Germany

are the Group units in London (around 39%), New York and 
Amsterdam, which altogether account for around 80% of the non-
German pension liabilities. Most of the foreign pension schemes are 
funded defined benefit plans. In some cases, there are also pension 
liabilities on a small scale outside Germany that are not covered by 
plan assets. 
The net liability or net asset resulting from the present value of 
the defined benefit obligations less the fair value of the plan assets, 
subject, if applicable, to the asset ceiling, is recognised in the 
balance sheet.  
The pension expenses for defined benefit plans, which are 
reported under personnel expenses and in net interest income, 
consist of the service cost and the net interest cost or income. 
Service cost comprises current service cost, which represents the 
entitlements earned by members during the financial year as well as 
the past service cost or income. Net interest expense/income is 
calculated as the difference in interest rate between the present value 
of the obligation and the fair value of the plan assets. When 
calculating the pension obligation with respect to the net liability and 
plan assets under defined benefit plans, the discount rate is applied. 
The difference between the remeasurement of the pension 
obligation on the reporting date as compared with the value 
projected at the beginning of the year is the actuarial gain or loss. 
Actuarial gains and losses are, like the return on plan assets (with 
the exception of amounts contained in net interest expense/ 
income), recognised directly in retained earnings within equity and 
are reported in the statement of comprehensive income.

The sensitivity analysis shown here reflects the changes in an 
assumption; the other assumptions remain unchanged from the 
original calculation, i.e. potential correlation effects between the 
individual assumptions are not accounted for. The effects of the 
assumption changes on the present value of the pension liabilities 
were determined using the same methods – in particular, the 
projected unit credit method – as used for the measurement of 
pension obligations as at the year-end. A change in the 
corresponding assumptions as at 31 December 2023 would have 
the following effects on the obligation:

b) Defined contribution plans 
 
Together 
with 
other 
financial 
institutions 
in 
Germany, 
Commerzbank is a member of BVV Versicherungsverein des 
Bankgewerbes a.G. (BVV), the occupational pension fund which 
provides retirement benefits to eligible employees in Germany. The 
contributions to the BVV are paid regularly by both the employer 
and the employee. The contributions paid by Commerzbank are 
recognised in personnel expenses. The BVV tariffs provide for fixed 
pension payments with profit participation. However, these plans 
are accounted for as defined contribution plans, as we do not have 
enough information on our share of the overall defined benefit 
obligation of each BVV plan and on the share of the relevant plan 
assets attributable to us. In the BVV scheme the employer bears 
subsidiary liability for the company pension scheme towards its 
own employees. There is also an obligation to make adjustments to 
compensate for inflation in favour of the beneficiaries, which could 
result in an increase in pension benefits. In addition, the BVV is 
entitled to demand further contributions from the member 
companies in case the economic situation of the BVV makes this 
necessary. 
However, no provisions for the BVV pension commitment were 
recognised either in the current or previous financial years, as 
recourse to this statutory liability is regarded as unlikely.  
Furthermore, some foreign subsidiaries and branches, primarily 
in the United Kingdom and the USA, also have defined contribution 
plans. The expenses for defined contribution plans included €59m 
(previous year: €62m) in payments to the BVV. Contributions in 
2024 are expected to be around the same amount.

The personnel provisions are predominantly short-term in nature, 
but also include provisions for long service awards, which are by 
their nature long-term and are utilised successively in following 
reporting periods. They also contain provisions for the long-term 
cash component of the Commerzbank Incentive Plan (CIP) which 
are utilised after the expiry of the three-year deferral period. The 
provisions listed under Other mostly have a residual term of under 
one year. 
The restructuring provisions relate primarily to personnel and, 
to a lesser extent, to real estate. The additions in the 2021 reporting 
year were made in connection with Strategy 2024, which envisages, 
among other things, job cuts in Germany and abroad by 2024, a 
reduction in the domestic branch network and the closure of 
locations, as well as the relocation of activities abroad. 
Legal disputes 
In case of legal proceedings or possible third-party recourse claims 
for which provisions need to be recognised, and which are contained 
in “Other provisions” under legal proceedings and recourse claims, 
neither the duration of the proceedings nor the level of utilisation of 
the provision can be predicted with certainty at the date the provision 
is recognised. The provisions cover the costs expected according to 
our judgement as at the reporting date.  
• Commerzbank and its subsidiaries operate in a large number of 
jurisdictions 
subject 
to 
different 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
requirements. In isolated cases in the past, infringements of legal 
and regulatory provisions have come to light and have been 
prosecuted by government agencies and institutions. Some 
companies within Commerzbank Group are currently still 
involved in a number of such cases.

• Commerzbank and its subsidiaries are especially active in the 
area of investment advisory within the Private and Small-Business 
Customers segment. The legal requirements for investor- and 
investment-oriented advisory services have been made more 
rigorous, especially in recent years. Commerzbank and its 
subsidiaries have consequently been involved in a number of legal 
disputes, some of which are still pending, with investors who claim 
to have received poor or inadequate investment advice and who 
demand compensation for damages or the reversal of investment 
transactions where information regarding commission fees was 
lacking (e.g. for closed-end funds).  
• Commerzbank is exposed to claims from customers owing to 
“cancellation joker” (“Widerrufsjoker”) issues. Following a 
change in the law, according to which any right to cancel loan 
agreements concluded between 2002 and 2010 could lapse no 
later than on 21 June 2016, many borrowers cancelled their 
agreements and asserted that the information given to them 
about cancellation when they concluded the agreement had 
been deficient. Some of them took legal action against the Bank 
when it refused to accept their cancellation, intending to 
immediately pay back the loan prior to the expiry of the fixed 
interest term without having to compensate the Bank for the loss 
incurred as a consequence of the early repayment. For 
agreements concluded after 2010, an attempt is also being made 
to use the cancellation joker to withdraw from the agreements 
prematurely. The Bank has contested these claims. We have not 
set out the provision amounts to avoid influencing the outcome 
of the proceeding. 
• A subsidiary of Commerzbank was involved in a South American 
bank which in the meantime has gone into liquidation. A number 
of investors and creditors of this bank have launched various legal 
actions in Uruguay and Argentina against the subsidiary, alleging 
liability as shareholders of the bankrupt companies as well as 
breaches of duty by the persons nominated by the subsidiary for 
the banks’ supervisory boards. In addition, the subsidiary was 
involved in two funds which raised money from investors and 
were managed by third parties. The liquidators of these funds 
have launched court proceedings in the USA demanding the 
repayment of amounts received by the subsidiary from the funds. 
We have not set out the provision amounts to avoid influencing 
the outcome of the proceeding. 
• In May 2017, a Polish court admitted a class action lawsuit 
against mBank alleging the ineffectiveness of index clauses in 
loan agreements denominated in Swiss francs. A total of 1,731 
plaintiffs have joined the class action. The claimants had 
appealed against the dismissing judgement of the court of first 
instance. In January 2024, the court of appeal referred the case 
back to the court of first instance for a new hearing.  
 
Independently of this, numerous borrowers of loans indexed in 
foreign currencies have also filed individual lawsuits for the 
same reasons. In addition to the class action, 22,602 other 
individual proceedings were pending as at 31 December 2023 
(previous year: 17,627). mBank has contested these claims.  
As at 31 December 2023, there were 4,528 final rulings relating 
to loans indexed in foreign currencies in individual proceedings 
against mBank, of which 104 were decided in favour of mBank 
and 4,424 were decided against mBank.  
The questions submitted to the ECJ by the Polish Supreme Court 
on the legality of the process for appointing new judges to the 
Polish Supreme Court are still unanswered and the further 
course of the proceedings and the outcome remain to be seen.  
In a request for a preliminary ruling from a Polish court to the 
ECJ in proceedings concerning mBank (C-140/22), the ECJ ruled 
in December 2023 that a consumer can choose not to assert 
unfairness of a contractual term and voluntarily agree to the 
contractual term, but is not obliged to assert the unfairness in 
court in order to enforce their rights. The ECJ also reaffirmed its 
case law from the ruling of 15 June 2023 (C-520/21) and rejected 
claims by the bank beyond the repayment of capital and the 
payment of statutory default interest.  
In proceedings against another bank (C-28/22), the ECJ ruled in 
December 2023 that the limitation period must be symmetrical 
for both parties; the limitation period for customer claims must 
not begin before the limitation period for the banks’ claims. The 
court also ruled that interest on arrears would continue to accrue 
during the period in which the bank exercised a right of 
retention.  
In a referral proceeding against another bank (C-756/22), 
questions were referred to the ECJ regarding the bank’s claims in 
the event of the reversal of loans; in its decision in December 2023, 
the ECJ referred to its ruling of 15 June 2023 (C-520/21) and 
confirmed that the bank has no claim against the consumer 
beyond the repayment of the capital and statutory default interest.  
In a referral proceeding at the ECJ concerning mBank  
(C-488/23), a decision was issued in January 2024 in which the 
court confirmed its ruling of 15 June 2023 (C-520/21), according 
to which a bank is not entitled to remuneration for the transfer 
of capital, not even in the form of compensation for the loss in 
value of the capital transferred (“valorisation”). 
mBank established a settlement programme beginning in the 
fourth quarter of 2022 that is aimed at all customers with active 
loans indexed in Swiss francs, including those who already have 
lawsuits against the bank. Customers will be offered the option of 
having their loans converted into zloty loans with a fixed or 
variable interest rate as well as the cancellation of an individually 
negotiated part of the outstanding loan value. As at the reporting 
date, mBank had accounted for risks in connection with future 
settlement payments in the amount of €285.7m. 
 
 
362 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
mBank has looked into the implications of the ECJ’s rulings and 
decisions and has examined and partly adjusted the parameters 
of the model, such as the expected number of borrowers who 
will still sue, the nature of the expected court judgements, the 
amount of the Bank’s loss in the event of a judgement and the 
acceptance rate for settlements. The methodology used to 
calculate the provision is based on parameters that are varied, 
discretionary and in some cases associated with considerable 
uncertainty. Fluctuations in the parameters as well as their 
interdependencies and rulings of the Polish courts and the ECJ 
may mean that the amount of the provision has to be adjusted 
significantly in the future. 
As at 31 December 2023, the portfolio of loans indexed in foreign 
currencies that have not been fully repaid had a carrying amount 
of 3.4bn Polish zloty. The portfolio of fully repaid loans and loans 
for which a settlement had been agreed or final ruling had been 
issued amounted to 11.2bn Polish zloty at the time of 
disbursement. Overall, the Group recognised a provision of 
€1.9bn (previous year: €1.4bn) for the risks arising from the 
matter, including potential settlement payments and the class 
action 
lawsuit,this 
relates 
almost 
exclusively 
to 
loans  
indexed in Swiss francs. In the case of loans that have not yet 
been fully repaid, the legal risks are taken into account in the 
gross carrying amounts of the receivables directly when 
estimating the cash flows, and not shown as a provision.  
• In proceedings relating to a specific retail mortgage loan 
agreement, a court overturned the finding of the lower court and 
ruled that the contractual clause concerning the calculation of 
prepayment penalty fees was insufficient and the prepayment 
penalty fee received by the Bank had to be refunded. The 
judgement is final. The Bank has recognised a corresponding 
provision for the possibility that a refund must be made in similar 
cases. We have not stated the provision amounts to avoid 
influencing the outcome of these cases. 
• In April 2021, the German Federal Court of Justice ruled on the 
mechanism for changes to banks’ general terms and conditions 
(AGB Banken) in a case against another bank and declared the 
relevant clauses of the general terms and conditions to be void. 
This mechanism stipulated that the customer’s consent to 
certain changes in the contract was given after a certain period 
of time if the customer had not objected. The Bank has analysed 
the impact of this case law on its business units and products, as 
the charges introduced or increased for consumers as a result of 
the mechanism for changes to banks’ general terms and 
conditions may be void. The Bank is being sued for repayment 
in some cases. We have not stated the provision amounts to 
avoid influencing the outcome of the proceedings. 
• Based on the circular on cum/cum transactions published by the 
Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2017, the tax auditors 
commented on the treatment of these transactions in the form of 
audit notes. The tax office reduced the credit for capital gains 
taxes accordingly. In response, Commerzbank made value 
adjustments to tax credits shown in the balance sheet and set up 
additional provisions for possible repayment claims in order to 
reflect the changed risk situation fully and appropriately. The 
BMF published a revised version of its circular on cum/cum 
transactions on 9 July 2021. In view of the potential impact of 
the BMF circular, the provision was adjusted in the second 
quarter of 2021. Based on current knowledge, the tax risks 
arising from this issue have thereby been adequately covered. 
The possibility of further charges over and above the provisions 
recognised by the Bank cannot be completely ruled out.  
• With respect to securities lending transactions, Commerzbank is 
exposed to compensation claims (including in court) from third 
parties for crediting entitlements that have been denied. In the 
context of these securities lending transactions, the contracting 
parties were obliged to reimburse Commerzbank for dividends 
and withholding tax. However, the tax offices of various 
contracting parties partially refused or subsequently disallowed 
subsequent crediting against corporate income tax. We have not 
stated the provision amounts to avoid influencing the outcome 
of the proceedings. 
• In a lawsuit filed in May 2019, a Commerzbank customer sought 
a ruling that the Bank must compensate the claimant for material 
damages caused by alleged false advice in connection with 
derivatives in the form of swap contracts. In the financial year 
the parties ended the legal dispute by means of a settlement. 
• A subsidiary of Commerzbank was sued by a customer in May 
2014 for compensation due to alleged fraudulent misselling of 
derivative transactions. The subsidiary has defended itself 
against the claim.

(55) Share-based remuneration plans 
Significant share-based remuneration plans 
a) Commerzbank Incentive Plan (CIP) 
The Commerzbank Incentive Plan (CIP), which was first launched 
in 2011, sets out the detailed rules for variable remuneration and 
applies to the entire Commerzbank Group. The CIP is an equity-
settled plan with a settlement option in cash for the employer, which 
falls within the scope of IFRS 2. In some locations different or 
supplementary CIP rules apply reflecting local legal or employment 
law requirements.  
The CIP regulates the payment conditions for variable 
remuneration for “risk takers”. The variable remuneration for this 
group of persons consists of a short-term incentive (STI) and, in the 
case of risk takers whose variable remuneration exceeds the risk 
taker limit, a long-term incentive (LTI). Under the CIP, if variable 
remuneration is granted, risk takers receive parts of their individual 
variable remuneration as a cash component and, if the risk taker 
exemption limit is exceeded, as a stock component that is linked to 
the performance of the Commerzbank share. 
A risk taker is an employee whose role has a material impact on 
Commerzbank’s overall risk profile. The criteria on the basis of 
which the risk takers are identified are divided into the categories 
of management responsibility, risk responsibility and remuneration 
level. Depending on the employee’s hierarchical level and the risk 
relevance of their role, the Bank designates what kind of risk taker 
the employee is: “risk taker I” or “risk taker II”. Risk taker I status 
applies to employees whose role entails a higher risk relevance. 
The risk taker limit is the amount up to which the payment of the 
entire variable remuneration for a financial year takes the form of a 
cash STI payment. For risk takers whose variable remuneration 
does not exceed the risk taker limit, and for employees without risk 
taker status (non-risk takers), variable remuneration is paid entirely 
as a cash STI. Only if the risk taker limit is exceeded is the variable 
remuneration divided up into STI and LTI components subject to the 
CIP rules applying to these components.  
The following rules apply once the risk taker limit has been 
exceeded: 
• For the risk taker I category, the STI component is 40% and the 
LTI component is 60% of the potential variable remuneration. 
50% of both the STI and LTI are paid in shares. 
• For the risk taker II category, the STI component is generally  
60% and the LTI component 40% of the potential variable 
remuneration. Half of both STI and LTI is share-based 
remuneration. 
An individual’s variable remuneration is determined on the basis 
of the results of their annual target attainment meeting 
(performance appraisal I), which is held in the first three months of 
the following financial year. The number of Commerzbank shares 
granted is set at the same time as the variable remuneration for both 
the STI and the LTI. If risk takers receive share-based remuneration 
components, the number of Commerzbank shares is calculated by 
dividing 50% of the euro amounts in the STI and the LTI by the 
subscription price. If there are any fractional amounts, the number 
of shares is rounded up. The subscription price for the variable 
remuneration set until the 2018 financial year is the simple 
arithmetic average of the Xetra closing prices of the Commerzbank 
share on all trading days during the reference period (December of 
the previous year and January and February of the next year). For 
the variable remuneration that has been set from the 2019 financial 
year onwards, the reference period for the subscription price is the 
month of January of the year following the financial year. 
Under the rules of the share-based remuneration components 
Commerzbank has the right to make a payment in cash rather than 
in shares. Use is made of this option as a rule. In the STI, the shares, 
or the optional cash settlement, are subject to a twelve-month 
lockup (“retention period”). This means that the STI share 
component of the financial year (n) will generally be paid out in 
April of the after next financial year (n+2). 
Under the LTI, since the amendment to the Remuneration 
Ordinance for Institutions (Institutsvergütungsverordnung) of 25 
September 2021 came into force, the entitlement to variable 
remuneration generally arises after the end of a deferral period of 
five years for risk takers I and four years for risk takers II, provided 
there are no other grounds under performance appraisal II to block 
the allocation. For risk takers I, Commerzbank has opted in favour 
of “pro-rata vesting”, according to which the entitlement to deferred 
variable remuneration arises on a pro rata basis during the retention 
period of five years. 
Performance appraisal II, which is held after the end of the 
deferral period, includes a review of performance appraisal I and of 
the conduct of the employee during the deferral period. In the LTI, 
if an entitlement arises, the shares or the optional cash settlement 
are also subject to a retention period, as in the STI. The payment of 
variable remuneration deferred until after the 2019 financial year 
will be made after completion of the performance appraisal II for 
risk takers I, for LTI Cash in November of the sixth year (n+6), and 
for LTI Equity in October of the seventh year (n+7). For risk takers 
II, LTI Cash was paid in November of the fourth year (n+4) and LTI 
Equity in October of the fifth year (n+5) until the 2021 financial year. 
From the 2022 financial year, LTI Cash will be paid in November of 
the fifth year (n+5) and LTI Equity in October of the sixth year (n+6). 
For risk takers I who fall under the executive model, which has been 
in effect since the 2023 financial year, the individual tranches of the 
LTI Cash and of the LTI Equity will be allocated pro rata temporis 
(annual vesting) over the term of the LTI. 
The payment date for the LTI Cash starting from the year (n + 2) 
to the year (n + 6) has been set for November, while for the LTI 
Equity starting from the year (n + 3) to the year (n + 7) it has been 
set for October. 
 
 
364 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
In the event of a cash settlement of the share component the 
cash amount is calculated on the basis of the simple arithmetic 
average of Xetra closing prices of the Commerzbank share on all 
trading days during the reference period. The reference period for 
entitlement to variable remuneration from the 2019 financial year 
onwards is the last full calendar month preceding the end of the 
retention period of the respective share-based remuneration 
components. 
If Commerzbank has paid dividends or carried out capital actions 
during the term of the CIP, since the 2019 financial year the deferral 
period does not confer any entitlement to compensation for 
dividends or subscription rights paid or granted to shareholders, 
unlike the retention period. 
The various remuneration components are estimated in the 
underlying financial year on the basis of budget forecasts, and 
provisions are recognised proportionally over the lifetime of the 
plans. Moreover, regular reviews, revaluations based on movements 
in the share price and/or adjustments of the amounts are carried out 
throughout the lifetime of the CIP.  
 
b) Share-based payment plans of mBank S.A. 
In 2012 a share-based programme was launched in which members 
of the Management Board could participate up until 2017. Until 
2013 this programme comprised both a short-term component 
(cash payment) and a long-term component which entitled the 
participants to make regular subscriptions to mBank shares over a 
period of three years. The programme was modified in 2014 and 
now consists of cash payments and the subscription of mBank 
shares in both components over three years. A given quantity of 
these shares were issued each year and made available to those 
entitled for purchase at a pre-determined price. In addition, a 
significant number of risk takers were added to this programme in 
2015. In all of these programmes, participation is linked to a 
minimum return on equity by the mBank sub-group. The long-term 
component of the programme from 2012 (modified in 2014) is also 
linked to the participants’ performance assessment.  
In 2018, the programme was technically adapted and the long-
term component for members of the Board of Managing Directors 
was extended from three to five years (pro rata). In 2021, the long-
term component for risk takers below the Board of Managing 
Directors was extended from three to five years (pro rata) for so-
called senior management positions, and from three to four years 
(pro rata) for all other risk takers below the Board of Managing 
Directors. 
Both plans, which entitle the holders to subscribe for mBank 
shares (firstly for members of the Board of Managing Directors from 
2012, modified in 2014 and with a technical adjustment in 2018, 
and secondly for risk takers below the Board of Managing Directors 
with a technical adjustment in 2021) are classified as share-based 
payments settled in the form of equity instruments. 
c) Remuneration of the Board of Managing Directors  
Please refer to the separate Remuneration report in the Group 
management report for a detailed account of the remuneration of 
members of the Board of Managing Directors. 
Accounting and valuation of share-based payment and bonus 
plans 
The staff compensation plans are accounted for under the rules of 
IFRS 2 – Share-based Payment and IAS 19 – Employee Benefits. A 
distinction is made between share-based remuneration payments 
settled in the form of equity instruments and those settled in cash. 
For both types of remuneration, however, the granting of share-
based remuneration has to be recognised at fair value in the Group 
financial statements. 
Accounting 
• Equity-settled 
share-based 
remuneration 
transactions:  
The fair value of share-based remuneration payments settled in 
the form of equity instruments is recognised as personnel 
expenses and reflected within equity in retained earnings. The 
fair value is determined on the date on which the rights are 
granted. If rights cannot be exercised because the conditions for 
exercise are not met due to market conditions, no change is 
made to the amounts already recognised in equity. However, if 
rights cannot be exercised because other conditions for exercise 
are not met (service and non-market conditions), the amounts 
already recognised in equity are adjusted through profit or loss. 
• Cash-settled 
share-based 
remuneration 
transactions: 
The portion of the fair value of share-based remuneration 
payments settled in cash that relates to services performed up to 
the date of measurement is recognised as personnel expenses 
while at the same time being recorded as a provision. The fair 
value is recalculated on each reporting date up to and including 
the settlement date. Any change in the fair value of the obligation 
must be recognised through profit or loss. On the date of 
settlement, therefore, the provision must correspond as closely 
as possible to the amount payable to the eligible employees. The 
provisions fluctuate on each subsequent reporting date in 
parallel 
with 
the 
performance 
of 
Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft share price. This affects the portion of the 
share-based variable remuneration that was determined using 
an average price for Commerzbank share. The price itself is 
determined as the average Xetra closing price of the months of 
January and February plus December of the previous year. 
Measurement 
The provision for the Commerzbank Incentive Plan is determined 
by multiplying the number of shares earned by participants by the 
closing price of the Commerzbank share on 31 December of the 
reporting year. The expense for the allocations to the provisions can

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
(56) Contingent liabilities and lending commitments 
 
This item mainly shows contingent liabilities arising from 
guarantees and indemnity agreements as well as irrevocable 
lending commitments at their nominal value.  
Situations where the reporting company acts as guarantor to the 
creditor of a third party for the fulfilment of a liability of that third 
party must be shown as guarantees. Indemnity agreements include 
contractual obligations that involve taking responsibility for a 
particular outcome or performance. These are normally guarantees 
issued at a customer’s request, which give us a right of recourse to 
the customer in the event that the guarantee is called upon. All 
obligations that could incur a credit risk must be shown here as 
irrevocable lending commitments. These include obligations to 
grant loans (e.g. credit lines that have been granted to customers), 
to buy securities or provide guarantees or acceptances. In contrast, 
loan commitments allocated to the trading portfolio are recognised 
under Financial assets – Held for trading or Financial liabilities – 
Held for trading. 
Provisions for risks in respect of contingent liabilities and 
lending commitments are included in provisions for off-balance-
sheet lending. 
Income from guarantees is reported in net commission income; 
the level of this income is determined by the application of agreed 
rates to the nominal amount of the guarantees. 
Legal risks where the occurrence of a loss cannot be ruled out 
but for which no provisions have been recognised because a claim 
is highly improbable, are also reported under contingent liabilities. 
We take a wide variety of factors into account in determining the 
probability of a loss, including the type of claims and judgements 
on similar issues. 
The Commerzbank Group extends credit facilities to its 
customers, granting them rapid access to funds to meet their short-
term and long-term financing needs. The credit facilities can be 
provided in different forms, as shown in the following examples:  
• guarantees, where the Group guarantees the repayment of a loan 
borrowed by a customer from another party;  
• standby letters of credit, which enhance a customer’s credit 
standing and enable the customer to obtain trade finance at a 
lower cost;  
• documentary credits for trade finance payments, which are 
made on behalf of a customer and where the Group is 
reimbursed at a later date;  
• standby facilities for short-term debt instruments and debt paper 
issued on a revolving basis, which enable customers to issue 
money market paper or medium-term debt instruments when 
needed without having to go through the normal issue procedure 
every time. 
Existing collateral may serve to cover the total liabilities of 
customers from loans and guarantees. Also, third parties may have 
sub-participations in irrevocable lending commitments and 
acceptances.  
The contingent liabilities also include the irrevocable payment 
obligation provided by the Single Resolution Board (SRB) after 
approval of the Bank’s request for security for payment of part of 
the banking levy. 
The figures listed in the table below do not take account of any 
collateral and would only have to be written off if all customers 
utilised their credit facilities completely and then defaulted (and 
there was no collateral). In practice, the majority of these facilities 
expire without ever being utilised. Consequently, these amounts are 
unrepresentative in terms of assessing risk, the actual future loan 
exposure 
or 
resulting 
liquidity 
requirements. 
The 
Group 
management report contains further information on credit risk and 
liquidity risk and how they are monitored and managed. Loan loss 
provisions for off balance-sheet commitments have been deducted 
from the respective items in these tables.

In addition to the credit facilities listed above, Commerzbank Group 
may also sustain losses from legal and tax risks the occurrence of 
which is not very probable and for which reason no provisions have 
been recognised. However, since there is some probability of their 
occurrence, they are presented under contingent liabilities. It is 
impossible to reliably estimate the date on which such risk may 
materialise or any potential reimbursements. Depending on the 
outcome of the legal and fiscal proceedings, the estimate of our risk 
of loss may prove to be either too low or too high. However, in a 
large majority of cases the contingent liabilities for legal risks do 
not ever materialise and, therefore, the amounts are not 
representative of the actual future losses. As at 31 December 2023, 
contingent liabilities for legal risks amounted to € 429m (previous 
year: € 563m) and related to the following material issues: 
• A customer sued Commerzbank for recovery of monies in April 
2016. The claimant is demanding the repayment of interest 
which in its view was wrongly paid to Commerzbank and is also 
demanding the release of collateral which is being held as 
security for a claim by Commerzbank against the claimant. The 
claimant appealed against the first instance judgment. 
Commerzbank is defending itself against the action.  
• A Commerzbank subsidiary together with another bank was 
sued for damages in February 2020 due to alleged unfair price 
collusion in connection with the levying of settlement fees. The 
subsidiary is defending itself against the action. 
• In February 2022, Commerzbank was sued in Hungary for 
damages in connection with a failed project. The lawsuit has 
been dismissed. 
• A Commerzbank subsidiary, together with another bank, was 
sued for damages in May 2018 due to alleged unfair price 
collusion in connection with the levying of settlement fees. An 
appeal against the second instance judgement in favour of the 
banks is still possible. 
• In 2018 a subsidiary of Commerzbank was sued by a customer 
for compensation due to alleged unlawful selling of collateral. 
The subsidiary is defending itself against the claim. 
• A subsidiary of the Bank was sued for damages in May 2023. 
The claimant is a shareholder of an insolvent company that had 
granted third-party collateral in favour of the subsidiary’s 
borrower. The subsidiary is defending itself against the action. 
 
The contingent liabilities for tax risks relate to the following material 
issues: 
• The public prosecutor’s office in Frankfurt is investigating equity 
transactions conducted by Commerzbank and the former 
Dresdner Bank around the dividend record date (cum-ex 
transactions). Commerzbank had already initiated a forensic 
analysis of cum-ex transactions at the end of 2015, which was 
concluded at the start of 2018 in respect of Commerzbank’s 
equity transactions and in September 2019 in respect of the 
equity transactions of the former Dresdner Bank. All back taxes 
demanded by the tax authorities have been paid. 
The public prosecutor’s office in Cologne has been conducting 
investigations at Commerzbank since September 2019 in 
connection with a separate case concerning cum-ex transactions. 
It is investigating on suspicion that the Bank (including Dresdner 
Bank) was involved in cum-ex transactions in various roles, 
including by supplying shares to third parties who were 
allegedly acting as short sellers. According to the current 
understanding, 
these 
proceedings 
do 
not 
involve 
Commerzbank’s own tax credit claims with regard to capital 
gains tax and the solidarity surcharge on dividends. 
 
 
368 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
The Bank is cooperating fully with authorities conducting 
investigations into cum-ex transactions. It is currently not 
possible to predict whether this will give rise to a burden or the 
amount thereof. 
 
Other contingent funding obligations 
• Commerzbank made use of the opportunity to meet part of its 
compulsory contributions for the EU banking levy and the 
Compensation Scheme of German Private Banks in the form of 
cash collateral and irrevocable payment commitments (IPCs).  
In the 2023 financial year, cash collateral in the amount of €42m 
was deposited for the EU bank levy and €30m for the 
Compensation Scheme of German Private Banks. Since 2015, a 
cumulative total of €181m has been deposited for the EU bank 
levy and €106m for the Compensation Scheme of German 
Private Banks. Cash collateral is reported under other assets.  
Accordingly, the 2023 financial year saw irrevocable payment 
commitments entered into in the amount of €72m. Since 2015, 
a cumulative total of €181m has been entered into for the EU 
bank levy and €106m for the Compensation Scheme of German 
Private Banks. The IPCs are reported as contingent liabilities.  
Following a ruling by the European General Court (EGC) against 
another bank on 25 October 2023 (T-688/21), which confirmed 
the retention, in the event that a bank’s authorisation is 
withdrawn, of contributions in the amount of the IPCs that it had 
made, Commerzbank re-examined during the 2023 financial 
year its accounting treatment of the cash collateral it had 
provided and the IPCs it had made. Since the applicant has 
lodged an appeal against this ruling, a final ruling from the ECJ is 
not expected until some time in the future. In the annual financial 
statements as at 31 December 2023, the cash collateral provided 
is still capitalised as other assets. Commerzbank considers the 
recoverability of the cash collateral to be given.  
It will continue to treat the irrevocable payment commitments as 
contingent liabilities. This is based on the assumptions that it is 
unlikely that Commerzbank’s authorisation will be withdrawn and 
that no significant resolution or compensation event that will have 
to be covered by the relevant protection schemes is expected in 
the foreseeable future. If the assumptions underlying the current 
accounting approach change, this could result in future charges 
against earnings of up to €287m in connection with the IPCs.

(57) Segment reporting 
 
Segment reporting reflects the results of the operating segments 
within Commerzbank Group. The following segment information is 
based on IFRS 8 Operating Segments, which applies the 
management approach. The segment information is prepared on 
the basis of internal management reporting, which the chief 
operating decision maker draws on in assessing the performance of 
the operating segments and determining the allocation of resources 
to the operating segments. Within Commerzbank Group, the 
function of chief operating decision maker is exercised by the Board 
of Managing Directors. 
In our segment reporting, we present the two business segments 
Private and Small-Business Customers and Corporate Clients 
separately. This reflects Commerzbank Group’s organisational 
structure and forms the basis for internal management reporting. 
The business segments are defined by differences in their products, 
services and/or customer target groups.  
There were no changes of the structure of the internal 
organization that changed the composition of the reportable 
segments in 2023. 
At the beginning of the financial year 2023, the operating 
segments’ capital requirement for risk-weighted assets have 
increased to 12.7% (previous year: 12.5%).  
Further information on the segments is provided in the Group 
management report section of this Annual Report. 
The performance of each segment is measured in terms of 
operating profit or loss and pre-tax profit or loss, as well as 
operating return on equity and the cost/income ratio. Operating 
profit or loss is defined as the sum of net interest income, dividend 
income, risk result, net commission income, net income from 
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit 
or loss, net income from hedge accounting, other net income from 
financial instruments, current net income from companies 
accounted for using the equity method and other net income less 
operating expenses and compulsory contributions. The operating 
profit does not include any impairments on goodwill or 
restructuring expenses. As we report pre-tax profits, non-
controlling interests are included in the figures for both profit and 
loss and average capital employed. All the revenue for which a 
segment is responsible is thus reflected in the pre-tax profit. When 
showing the elimination of intragroup profits from intragroup 
transactions in segment reporting, the transferring segment is 
treated as if the transaction had taken place outside the Group. 
Intragroup profits and losses are therefore eliminated in Others and 
Consolidation. 
The operating return on equity is calculated as the ratio of 
operating profit to average capital employed. It shows the return on 
the capital employed in a given segment. The cost/income ratio in 
operating business reflects the cost efficiency of the various 
segments. It is calculated from the ratio of the sum of operating 
expenses and compulsory contributions to income before the risk 
result. We also report a cost/income ratio in operating business that 
excludes compulsory contributions, to take account of the fact that 
this item cannot be influenced in terms of either amount or 
periodicity. 
Income and expenses are reported within the segments by 
originating unit and at market prices, with the market interest rate 
method being used for interest operations. The actual funding costs 
for the business-specific equity holdings of the segments are shown 
in net interest income. The Group’s return on capital employed is 
allocated to the net interest income of the various segments in 
proportion to the average capital employed in the segment. The 
interest rate used is the long-term risk-free rate on the capital 
market. Net interest income also contains liquidity costs. These 
costs include both externally paid funding costs as well as the 
complete allocation of liquidity costs to the businesses and 
segments based on our transfer price system for liquidity costs. This 
system is used to allocate the interest expenses resulting from the 
Bank’s external funding to the individual transactions and portfolios 
of the segments. This allocation is based on a central liquidity price 
curve in accordance with cost causation. The average capital 
employed in the segments is calculated based on the average 
segmented risk-weighted assets. At Group level, Common Equity 
Tier 1 (CET1) capital is shown, which is used to calculate the 
operating return on equity. The reconciliation of average capital 
employed in the segments to the Group’s CET1 capital is carried out 
in Others and Consolidation. We also report the assets and liabilities 
for the individual segments and the carrying amounts of companies 
accounted for using the equity method. Due to our business model, 
the segment balance sheet only balances out at Group level. 
The operating expenses reported under operating profit or loss 
contain personnel expenses, administrative expenses (excluding 
compulsory contributions) as well as amortisation, depreciation and 
write-downs on fixed assets and other intangible assets. 
Restructuring expenses and impairments of both goodwill are 
reported below the operating profit line in pre-tax profit or loss. 
Operating expenses and compulsory contributions are attributed to 
the individual segments on the basis of cost causation. The indirect 
expenses arising in connection with internal services are charged 
to the user of the service and credited to the segment performing 
the service. The provision of intragroup services is charged at full 
cost or at market prices.

Under “Consolidation” we report consolidation and reconciliation 
items from the results of the segments and “Others” affecting the 
Group financial statements. This relates primarily to the following 
items: 
• Elimination of the net measurement gains or losses on own 
bonds incurred in the segments; 
• Effects from the consolidation of intragroup-transactions 
between segments; 
• Effects from the consolidation of expenses and income; and 
• Income and operating expenses of staff and management 
functions, which are charged to the segments and Others. 
 
The breakdown within segment reporting by geographical region, 
which is essentially based on the location of the branch or group 
entity, was as follows:

Of the income before loan loss provisions in Europe (not including 
Germany), around 19% was from our units in the United Kingdom 
(previous year: 26%), 54% from our units in Poland (previous year: 
50%) and 3% from our units in Luxembourg (previous year: 5%). 
Instead of long-term assets, we report the risk weighted assets for 
credit risks. Of the risk weighted assets for credit risks in Europe 
(not including Germany), around 53% was from our units in Poland 
(previous year: 45%), 28% by our units in the United Kingdom 
(previous year: 22%) and 7% by our units in Luxembourg (previous 
year: 21%). 
In accordance with IFRS 8.32 Commerzbank has decided not to 
provide a breakdown of Commerzbank Group’s total income by 
products and services. We decided not to collect this data for 
efficiency reasons, as it is used neither for internal management 
activities nor for management reporting.

Cash and cash equivalents do not contain any effects from 
companies consolidated for the first time or from deconsolidations, 
either in the current financial year or in the previous year.  
The cash flow statement shows the structure of and changes in 
cash and cash equivalents during the financial year. It is broken 
down into operating activities, investing activities and financing 
activities. 
Net cash from operating activities includes payments (inflows and 
outflows) relating to loans and advances and also securities and 
other assets. Increases and decreases in deposits, bonds and notes 
issued and other liabilities also belong to operating activities. The 
interest and dividend payments resulting from operating activities 
are similarly reflected in net cash from operating activities. 
Changes in net cash from operating activities also resulted from 
disposals of consolidated companies. The tables below provide an 
overview of the assets and liabilities at the disposal dates:

Net cash from investing activities is made up of cash flows relating 
to payment transactions for intangible assets, fixed assets and 
companies accounted for using the equity method. Net cash from 
financing activities consists of the proceeds of capital increases as 
well as payments made or received on subordinated deposits and 
debt instruments. Dividends paid are also reported here. 
The cash holdings include cash and cash equivalents which can 
be directly converted to liquid assets and are only subject to an 
insignificant value fluctuation risk. Here we include the item “Cash 
on hand and cash on demand”, which contains cash on hand, 
balances held at central banks, sight deposits at banks due on 
demand, and debt issued by public-sector borrowers. 
The ability of the Commerzbank Group to access cash inflows 
from or outflows to subsidiaries, including structured entities, 
associated companies and joint ventures, can be subject to legal, 
regulatory and contractual restrictions. 
With regard to Commerzbank Group, the cash flow statement is not 
very informative. The cash flow statement neither replaces the 
liquidity/financial planning for us, nor is it used as a management tool.

The conditions for capital increases from authorised capital as at 
31 December 2023 are stipulated in the Articles of Association of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft dated 29 September 2023. 
The Board of Managing Directors is authorised, with the 
approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the Company’s share 
capital until 30 May 2028 through the issuance of new shares with 
no par value in exchange for cash, in either one or several tranches, 
but not exceeding a maximum amount of €438,325,172.00 
(Authorised Capital 2023/I). In principle, shareholders shall be 
offered subscription rights; the statutory subscription right may also 
be granted in such manner that the new shares are underwritten by 
one or more banks or enterprises equivalent to a bank pursuant to 
Art. 186 (5) sentence 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act under 
an obligation to offer them for subscription to shareholders of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. However, the Board of Managing 
Directors is authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, 
to exclude shareholders’ subscription rights in the following cases: 
• to exclude fractional amounts from subscription rights; 
• in order to issue shares to employees of Commerzbank Aktien-
gesellschaft or of companies in which Commerzbank Aktien-
gesellschaft directly or indirectly holds a majority interest 
(Group companies as defined in Art. 18 (1) of the Stock 
Corporation Act) up to a proportional amount of the share 
capital of €15,000,000.00. 
If shares are issued against cash to employees of the Company 
or of its Group companies within the meaning of Art. 18 (1) of the 
Stock Corporation Act with the exclusion of shareholders’ 
subscription rights, the proportional amount of the share capital 
attributable to them may not exceed a total of 3% of the share 
capital of the Company existing at the time of the resolution of the 
Annual General Meeting. This 3% limit shall take into account the 
proportional share capital issued against cash or contributions in 
kind or sold during the term of this authorisation under another 
authorisation with the exclusion of shareholders’ subscription 
rights to members of the Board of Managing Directors, members of 
the management or employees of the Company or of its Group 
companies within the meaning of Art. 18 (1) of the German Stock 
Corporation Act. The Board of Managing Directors is authorised to 
determine the further details of the capital increase and its 
implementation.  
The Board of Managing Directors is authorised, with the 
approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the Company’s share 
capital until 30 May 2028 through the issuance of new shares with 
no par value in exchange for cash or contributions in kind, in either 
one or several tranches, but not exceeding a maximum amount of 
€125,235,763.00 (Authorised Capital 2023/II). In principle, 
shareholders shall be offered subscription rights; the statutory 
subscription right may also be granted in such manner that the new 
shares are underwritten by one or more banks or enterprises

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
equivalent to a bank pursuant to Art. 186 (5) sentence 1 of the 
German Stock Corporation Act under an obligation to offer them for 
subscription to shareholders of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft. 
However, the Board of Managing Directors is authorised, with the 
approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders’ 
subscription rights in the following cases: 
• to exclude fractional amounts from subscription rights; 
• to the extent necessary, to grant the holders of conversion or 
option rights, either already issued or still to be issued by 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft or by companies in which 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft directly or indirectly holds a 
majority interest (Group companies as defined in Art. 18 (1) of 
the Stock Corporation Act), subscription rights in the amount to 
which they would be entitled after exercising their conversion or 
option rights or fulfilling their corresponding conversion or 
option obligation; 
• in order to increase the share capital in exchange for 
contributions in kind; 
• in the event of capital increases for cash, if the issue price of the 
new shares is not significantly lower than the market price for 
identical shares of the Company at the time the issue price is 
determined. The shares issued subject to the exclusion of 
subscription rights pursuant to Art. 203 (1) and Art. 186 (3) 
sentence 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act on the basis of 
this authorisation may not exceed a total of 10% of the share 
capital of the Company, either at the time the authorisation 
becomes effective or at the time the authorisation is exercised, 
whichever amount is lower. The upper limit of 10% of the share 
capital is reduced by the proportional amount of share capital 
corresponding to those of the Company’s own shares that are 
sold during the period of validity of Authorised Capital 2023/II, 
while excluding shareholders’ subscription rights in accordance 
with Art. 71 (1) no. 8 sentence 5 and Art. 186 (3) sentence 4 of 
the German Stock Corporation Act. The upper limit is further 
reduced by the proportional amount of share capital 
corresponding to those shares that must be issued to service 
options and convertible bonds with option or conversion rights 
or with option or conversion obligations, provided such bonds 
are issued during the period of validity of Authorised Capital 
2023/II, while excluding subscription rights subject to 
appropriate application of Art. 186 (3) sentence 4 of the German 
Stock Corporation Act. 
The proportional amount of the share capital attributable to 
those shares issued in exchange for cash or contributions in kind 
with exclusion of the shareholders’ subscription right must not, in 
aggregate, exceed 10% of the share capital of the Company 
existing at the time when the General Meeting adopts the resolution. 
Regarding the above limit, those shares shall be taken into account 
– subject to any renewed authorisation to exclude subscription 
rights that may be adopted as a resolution by a subsequent Annual 
General Meeting – which are issued subject to exclusion of the 
subscription right during the term of this authorisation under 
another authorisation, or on which financial instruments with 
conversion or option rights or obligations are based which are 
issued subject to exclusion of the subscription right of the 
shareholders during the term of the authorisation under another 
authorisation. If shares are issued to members of the Board of 
Managing Directors, members of the management or employees of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and its Group companies within 
the meaning of Art. 18 (1) of the Stock Corporation Act with the 
exclusion of shareholders’ subscription rights against contributions 
in kind by contributing claims for variable remuneration 
components, bonuses or similar claims against the Company or its 
Group companies, the Board of Managing Directors may only make 
use of the authorisation up to a maximum total amount of 3% of 
the share capital existing at the time of the resolution by the Annual 
General Meeting. This 3% limit shall take into account the 
proportional share capital issued against cash or contributions in 
kind or sold during the term of this authorisation under another 
authorisation with the exclusion of shareholders’ subscription 
rights to members of the Board of Managing Directors, members of 
the management or employees of the Company or of its Group 
companies within the meaning of Art. 18 (1) of the German Stock 
Corporation Act. The Board of Managing Directors is authorised to 
determine the further details of the capital increase and its 
implementation.

(62) Related party transactions 
 
As part of its normal business, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft 
and/or its consolidated companies engage in transactions with 
related entities and persons. These also include subsidiaries that 
are controlled but not consolidated for reasons of materiality, joint 
ventures, associated companies, external providers of occupational 
pensions for employees of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, key 
management personnel and members of their families as well as 
companies and joint ventures controlled by these persons. Banking 
transactions with related parties are carried out at normal market 
terms and conditions. In some cases, prior-year figures were 
adjusted due to changes in allocations. 
Key management personnel refers exclusively to members of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft’s Board of Managing Directors 
and Supervisory Board who were active during the financial year.  
Besides the stake held by the German federal government, other 
factors (including membership of the Supervisory Board) that could 
potentially allow a significant influence to be exerted on 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft also need to be taken into account. 
Accordingly, the German federal government and entities 
controlled by it are classified as related entities and persons in 
accordance with IAS 24.

ordinary banking activities, the Bank granted guarantees and 
collateral totaling €86m (previous year: €89m). 
 
Transactions with joint ventures 
The assets relating to joint ventures of €24m (previous year: €26m) 
included mainly loans and receivables as at 31 December 2023. As in 
the previous year, no transactions took place with joint ventures.

the financial year amounted to €16m and resulted mainly from

course of its ordinary banking activities, the Bank granted 
guarantees and collateral totalling €3m (previous year: €3m). 
 
Transactions with other related entities/persons 
The assets relating to other related entities/persons amounted to

The total remuneration in accordance with Art. 314 (1) no. 6 (a) 
sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code for the members of the 
Board of Managing Directors does not include any payments of 
long-term components of the remuneration for the 2023 financial 
year, as these can be granted by the Supervisory Board in a legally 
binding manner only after a retention period of 5 to 7 years and the 
completion of a retrospective performance evaluation. The total 
remuneration therefore also includes the payment of long-term 
components of the remuneration for the 2018 financial year 
(previous year: for 2017 financial year), since these were legally 
binding in the year under review. Total remuneration also includes 
157,429 (previous year: 149,488) virtual shares with a total value of 
€1,674 thousand (previous year: €1,470 thousand), which will not 
be paid out until spring of 2023 or in 2025 at the share price valid 
prior to the respective payment. These virtual shares were included 
in the total remuneration in accordance with German Accounting 
Standard No. 17 (DRS 17) at the share price on the day they were 
granted by the Supervisory Board plus any dividend adjustment for 
the dividend in the 2018 financial year. 
The net present value of the pension entitlements of the 
members of the Board of Managing Directors who were active in 
the financial year was €11,031 thousand as at 31 December 
2023 (previous year: €8,419 thousand). After deduction of plan 
assets transferred, provisions for pension obligations in respect of 
members of the Board of Managing Directors active in the financial 
year were €990 thousand as at 31 December 2023 (previous year: 
€985 thousand). Provisions of €11,100 thousand were recognised 
for variable components of remuneration of active members of the 
Board of Managing Directors as at 31 December 2023 (previous 
year: €13,300 thousand).  
 
The assets backing the Bank’s retirement benefit plan for 
present and former members of the Board of Managing Directors 
or their 
surviving 
dependants have 
been transferred to 
Commerzbank Pensions-Trust e.V. as part of a contractual trust 
arrangement. Payments to former members of the Board of 
Managing Directors of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and their 
surviving dependants in the financial year came to €8,427 thousand 
(previous year: €13,591 thousand). The pension obligations for 
these persons amounted to €104,820 thousand (previous year: 
€98,580 thousand). 
 
Supervisory Board  
Remuneration for the members of the Supervisory Board is 
regulated in Art. 15 of the Articles of Association of Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft. Members of the Supervisory Board received 
total net remuneration of €3,688 thousand for the 2023 financial 
year (previous year: €3,483 thousand), as short-term employee 
benefits in accordance with IAS 24.17.

(66) Information on unconsolidated structured entities 
 
The unconsolidated structured entities of Commerzbank Group 
comprise the transaction types (clusters) set out below: 
• Asset-backed securities (ABS) 
Asset-backed securities are collateralised securities designed to 
convert particular assets, usually loans, into interest-bearing 
tradeable securities through securitisation. The underlying 
assets may include, for example, consumer loans (auto loans, 
credit card assets), mortgage loans and high-grade corporate 
loans. The companies are financed through the issue of various 
tranches of asset-backed securities. Investors in these securities 
are subject to the default risk of the underlying asset. 
Commerzbank only invests in investment grade ABS tranches. 
• Own securitisations and securitisation platform 
Commerzbank’s own securitisations are true-sale and synthetic 
securitisations used for the purpose of steering the liquidity, 
capital and risk-weighted assets of the Bank. The companies that 
acquire the assets are financed through the issue of various 
tranches of securities that are placed on the capital market. 
Furthermore, Commerzbank also sponsors a securitisation 
platform (Silver Tower). With this securitisation program, 
Commerzbank 
structures, 
arranges 
and 
securitises 
the 
receivables of third parties who are customers of the Corporate 
Clients segment. The refinancing takes place through credit 
lines or registered bonds issued by Luxembourg-based Silver 
Tower S.A. In addition to existing over-collateralisation, the risk 
of bad debts is partly covered by external credit insurance. 
• Leasing property companies 
These companies design need-based leasing and financing 
concepts for large plant such as real estate, aircraft, ships and 
regenerative energy systems. Normally, for every transaction, an 
autonomous special-purpose company is established in which 
the Commerz Real Group is a majority or minority stakeholder. 
As a financial services company, the Commerz Real Group does 
not provide loans to these companies. Loans are instead 
provided by lending institutions within and outside the Group. 
The core business of the Commerz Real Group does, however, 
include administration related to the structured entities. 
• Other 
These are structured entities that are not included in the above 
categories. This category mainly includes capital market 
transactions by Asset Finance (AF) and structured transactions 
in connection with credit derivatives transactions. AF carries out 
transactions for customers with limited access to the capital 
markets and brings them together with alternative providers of 
capital. The focus in Structured Asset Finance is on structuring 
and distributing financing and investment solutions for 
corporate customers and financial institutions. Structured Asset 
Finance concentrates on the financing of tangible assets and 
other assets using leasing or structured financing. This also 
includes the involvement of alternative providers of capital from 
outside the banking sector. These activities are supplemented 
with the structuring of investment solutions, and the 
underwriting and placement of suitable financings for that 
purpose.

The carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities and income 
and expenses of Commerzbank Group relating to unconsolidated 
structured entities are set out in the tables below: The size of the 
unconsolidated structured entities and Commerzbank Group’s 
maximum exposure to loss are also shown.  
The maximum exposure to loss for Commerzbank Group with 
regard to unconsolidated structured entities results from 
recognised assets and from lending commitments and guarantees 
provided to unconsolidated structured entities that had not yet been 
utilised as at the reporting dates. The maximum risk of loss on 
assets with regard to unconsolidated structured entities is 
equivalent to the current carrying values of these items after the risk 
result. For loan commitments and guarantees we treat the nominal 
value of the commitment as the maximum risk of loss. 
The maximum risk of loss is shown gross, i.e. without regard to 
collateral or hedging activities serving the purpose of risk mitigation.

Commerzbank also acts as sponsor of structured entities in which it 
does not have an equity holding. An entity is regarded as sponsored 
if: 
• it was launched and/or structured by Commerzbank; 
• it has received or bought assets from Commerzbank Group; 
• it is guaranteed by Commerzbank Group or was marketed 
intensively by Commerzbank Group. 
As at 31 December 2023, the gross income of Commerzbank Group 
from sponsored unconsolidated structured entities was €7m 
(previous year: €–27m). The carrying amounts of the assets of 
Commerzbank Group relating to sponsored unconsolidated 
structured entities totalled €1,463m (previous year: €1,761m).

Report on events after the reporting period 
 
On 9 January 2024, the Board of Managing Directors of 
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft resolved to carry out a share 
buyback for a total purchase price of up to €600m (the 2024 Share 
Buyback Programme). The buyback began on 10 January 2024 via 
the Xetra-trading system of the Frankfurt stock exchange and will 
be completed on or before 4 April 2024. The purpose of the share 
buyback is to reduce the share capital of Commerzbank 
Aktiengesellschaft. The repurchased shares will accordingly be 
cancelled. There have been no other events of particular 
significance since the end of the financial year.

Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
To COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main 
 
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the 
Group Management Report 
 
Opinions 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of 
COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, and its 
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the balance sheet as at  
31 December 2023, the income statement, the condensed 
statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in 
equity and the cash flow statement for the financial year from  
1 January to 31 December 2023, and notes, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the 
group management report of COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft 
for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. 
In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not 
audited the content of those components of the group management 
report specified in the “Other Information” section of our auditor's 
report. 
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, 
• the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in 
all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and 
the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant 
to Section 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German 
Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial 
position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its 
financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to  
31 December 2023, and 
• the accompanying group management report as a whole 
provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all 
material respects, this group management report is consistent 
with the consolidated financial statements, complies with 
German legal requirements and appropriately presents the 
opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on 
the group management report does not cover the content of 
those components of the group management report specified in 
the "Other Information" section of the auditor's report. 
Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our 
audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance 
of the consolidated financial statements and the group management 
report. 
Basis for the Opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
and of the group management report in accordance with Section 
317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation No 537/2014 (referred to 
subsequently as "EU Audit Regulation") and in compliance with 
German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement 
Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) 
[Institute of Public Auditors in Germany]. Our responsibilities under 
those requirements and principles are further described in the 
"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report" 
section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group 
entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and 
German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our 
other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2)(f) of the 
EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-
audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit 
Regulation. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the 
consolidated financial statements and on the group management 
report. 
Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 
1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as 
a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.

Calculation of model-based loan loss provisions for credit losses

the consolidated financial statements. For information on 
impairment losses under IFRS 9, please refer to Note 31 "Credit 
risks and credit losses" in the consolidated financial statements. 
 
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK 
In its consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023, 
COMMERZBANK Aktien-gesellschaft presents loan loss provisions 
for risks arising from loans and advances in Stage 1 in the amount 
of EUR 268 million and in Stage 2 in the amount of EUR 985 million. 
In accordance with accounting standard IFRS 9 – Financial 
Instruments, COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft uses a three-
stage approach to measure loan loss provisions, with an ECL model 
being used to calculate the expected credit losses (ECL). The loan 
loss provisions in Stage 1 correspond to the expected credit losses 
within the next twelve months. The loan loss provisions for Stage 2 
relate to financial instruments whose credit risk has increased 
significantly since initial recognition, while the loan loss provisions 
in Stage 3 are attributable to credit-impaired financial assets. The 
loan loss provisions in Stages 2 and 3 take into account all expected 
credit losses for the entire remaining term.  
Calculating the loan loss provisions for expected credit losses in 
Stages 1 and 2 requires judgement and the use of complex models, 
inputs and assumptions. The loan loss provision is determined 
using the following inputs: probability of default (PD), loss given 
default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). 
Economic uncertainty and the consequences of the geopolitical 
tensions are still strongly overshadowing the macroeconomic 
outlook. The model-based inputs used for calculating loan loss 
provisions do not yet fully reflect these effects. COMMERZBANK 
Aktiengesellschaft recognised a top-level adjustment (TLA) for 
secondary effects to take account of this matter. 
There is the risk for the financial statements that inappropriate 
models or inputs are used for the calculation of loan loss provisions 
for expected credit losses in Stages 1 and 2. 
 
OUR AUDIT APPROACH 
Based on our risk assessment and evaluation of the risks of material 
misstatement, we used both control-based and substantive audit 
procedures for our audit opinion.  
We tested the design, implementation and effectiveness of the 
relevant controls used to determine loan loss provisions and 
performed additional substantive audit procedures. 
Among others, our audit included control testing procedures 
related to: 
• Calculation of input-based loan loss provisions 
• Derivation of top-level adjustments for the input-based loan loss 
provisions and 
• Validation of the input-based loan loss provision models.  
We took account of the results of our control testing for the 
determination of the nature and scope of the other substantive audit 
procedures. These included in particular: 
• Evaluation of the methods and accounting policies for 
determining loan loss provisions according to IFRS 9 
• Evaluation of validations of the Bank for selected significant 
models and recalculation of validation tests 
• Assessment of the appropriateness of the key assumptions for 
the stage allocation, macroeconomic variables, scenarios and 
their weighting 
• Risk-based recalculation of loan loss provisions for Stage 1 and 
Stage 2 
• Review of the ratings and solvency for selected borrowers based 
on the information in the respective loan files and assessment of 
the criteria used to identify a significant increase in credit risk 
as well as 
• Comprehension of the input-based loan loss provision 
calculation, including the calculation methodology for top-level 
adjustments.  
 
OUR CONCLUSIONS 
The valuation models and inputs used to determine the loan loss 
provisions for expected credit losses in Stages 1 and 2 are 
appropriate. 
 
Valuation of financial instruments for which no observable market 
prices on active markets are available 
 
The significant accounting and measurement policies are described 
in Note 3 "Significant principles and uncertainties in estimates" in 
the consolidated financial statements. For information on financial 
instruments, please refer to Note 35 "IFRS 13 fair value hierarchies 
and disclosure requirements" in the consolidated financial 
statements. 
 
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK 
In its consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023, 
COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft presents financial assets in the 
amount of EUR 89.2 billion and financial liabilities in the amount of 
EUR 55.3 billion as fair value Level 2 financial instruments. In 
addition, COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft presents financial  
 
 
408 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
assets in the amount of EUR 3.7 billion and financial liabilities in 
the amount of EUR 0.6 billion as fair value Level 3 financial 
instruments.  
The fair values of these financial instruments are to be 
determined based on recognised valuation methods. The valuation 
methods used may be based on complex models and include 
assumptions requiring judgements, especially for unobservable 
inputs. 
The risk for the financial statements in particular is that 
inappropriate valuation models and inputs are used to determine 
the fair values of Level 2 and Level 3 financial instruments. 
 
OUR AUDIT APPROACH 
Based on our risk assessment and evaluation of the risks of material 
misstatement, we used both control-based and substantive audit 
procedures for our audit opinion.  
We tested the design, implementation and effectiveness of the 
controls relevant for the determination of fair values and performed 
additional substantive audit procedures. In doing this, we involved 
KPMG's in-house valuation experts. 
Among others, our audit included control testing procedures 
related to: 
• Validation carried out of newly introduced or modified valuation 
models and the continual monitoring processes of existing 
valuation models 
• Independent review of the market inputs and data used for 
measurement as well as 
• Determination and recognition of necessary value adjustments.  
We took account of the results of our control testing for the 
determination of the nature and scope of the other substantive audit 
procedures. The substantive audit procedures included in particular: 
• Performance of our own independent price verification with the 
involvement of KPMG's in-house valuation experts for selected 
financial instruments, valuation methods, inputs and models as 
well as 
• Recalculation and comprehension of the calculation of fair value 
adjustments made, including their recognition.  
 
OUR CONCLUSIONS 
The valuation models and inputs used to determine the fair value of 
Level 2 and Level 3 financial instruments are appropriate. 
 
Calculation of the provision for legal risks from loans denominated in 
Swiss franc 
The significant accounting and measurement policies are described 
in Note 3 "Significant principles and uncertainties in estimates" in 
the consolidated financial statements. For information on legal risks 
from loans denominated in Swiss franc, please refer to Note 54 
"Provisions" in the consolidated financial statements. 
 
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK 
In its consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023, 
COMMERZBANK Aktien-gesellschaft presents a provision for legal 
risks from loans granted in the past and denominated in foreign 
currencies by a subsidiary in the amount of EUR 1.9 billion. The 
predominant part applies to Swiss franc.  
COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft is facing a class action 
lawsuit as well as numerous individual claims due to alleged 
ineffectiveness of index clauses in loan agreements denominated in 
Swiss franc. In this context, there is substantial uncertainty 
surrounding the expected cash flows from the loans affected.  
The Bank assesses the impacts on the expected cash flows from 
loans denominated in Swiss franc based on probabilities for 
different scenarios of future events, such as the outcome of pending 
court proceedings and future settlement agreements with clients. 
This involves assumptions being made about the expected number 
of pending court proceedings, the probability of losing these cases 
and the results of settlement agreements with clients, which are 
heavily subject to judgement.  
There is the risk for the financial statements that inappropriate 
assumptions are made for the calculation of provisions for the 
expected burden arising from loans denominated in Swiss franc.  
 
OUR AUDIT APPROACH 
Based on our risk assessment and the evaluation of risks of material 
misstatement, we based our opinion on substantive audit 
procedures. These included in particular: 
• Assessment of the method for estimating the financial impacts 
of the loans denominated in Swiss franc and the related 
accounting policy 
• Assessment of the accuracy and completeness of significant data 
included in the estimation of the provision 
• Obtaining lawyer confirmations about the number of pending 
procedures and 
• Evaluation of significant assumptions for the estimation of 
financial impacts of the risk, especially the probabilities of future 
scenarios for future settlements with clients, the development of 
the number of claims as well as the probability of losing these 
cases.  
 
OUR CONCLUSIONS 
The assumptions made for the calculation of provisions for the 
expected burden arising from loans denominated in Swiss franc are 
appropriate.

Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets 
The significant accounting and measurement policies are described 
in Note 3 "Significant principles and uncertainties in estimates" in 
the consolidated financial statements. For information on deferred 
tax assets, please refer to Note 48 "Tax assets" in the consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK 
In its consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023, 
COMMERZBANK Aktien-gesellschaft presents deferred tax assets 
of EUR 2.5 billion.  
The recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets require 
judgements and also necessitate – besides the consideration of 
objective factors – numerous estimates of future taxable earnings 
and the usability of tax losses and previously unused tax credits.  
The usability of the assets is estimated especially based on future 
taxable earnings potential according to corporate planning, which, 
in consideration of the expected changes in significant value-
determinant assumptions and inputs contained therein, is subject 
to estimation uncertainty. These include in particular assumptions 
on the development of pre-tax earnings, the influence of potential 
special items as well as permanent effects, which determine the 
positive taxable earnings available in the future. The assumptions 
also concern political and economic developments and conditions, 
specific national tax regulations and tax planning strategies, as well 
as the transformation as part of the Strategy 2024 programme 
respectively the Strategic Plan 2027. 
There is the risk for the financial statements that inappropriate 
assumptions are made regarding the future usability of deferred tax 
assets.  
 
OUR AUDIT APPROACH 
Based on our risk assessment and evaluation of the risks of material 
misstatement, we used both control-based and substantive audit 
procedures for our audit opinion.  
We tested the design, implementation and effectiveness of the 
controls relevant for the determination of deferred tax assets and 
performed additional substantive audit procedures. In doing this, 
we involved our KPMG in-house tax experts. 
Among others, our audit included control testing procedures 
regarding the development of the assumptions used to determine 
the future taxable profit. 
We took account of the results of our control testing for the 
determination of the nature and scope of the other substantive audit 
procedures. These included in particular: 
• Evaluation of the methodology applied by COMMERZBANK 
Aktiengesellschaft for the recognition and measurement of 
deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of IAS 12 
• Evaluation of the appropriateness of the inputs used in corporate 
planning 
about 
COMMERZBANK 
Aktiengesellschaft's 
expectations regarding future taxable earnings and 
• Evaluation of the interpretation of various tax laws and 
requirements and the materialisation of future taxable earnings 
as well as the suitability and feasibility of tax planning strategies. 
 
OUR CONCLUSIONS 
The assumptions made on the future usability of deferred tax assets 
are appropriate.  
Other Information 
The Board of Managing Directors respectively the Supervisory 
Board are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the following components of the group 
management report, whose content was not audited: 
• the combined separate non-financial report of the Company and 
the Group, which is referred to in the group management report  
• the declaration on corporate governance referred to in the group 
management report. 
The other information also includes the remaining parts of the 
annual report. 
The other information does not include the consolidated 
financial statements, the group management report information 
audited for content and our auditor's report thereon. 
Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the 
group management report do not cover the other information, and 
consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other 
information  
• is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial 
statements, with the group management report information 
audited for content or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or  
• otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information 
that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard. 
 
 
 
 
410 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
Responsibilities of the Board of Managing Directors and the 
Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements 
and the Group Management Report 
The Board of Managing Directors is responsible for the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material 
respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional 
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e 
(1) HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in 
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of 
the Group. In addition, the Board of Managing Directors is 
responsible for such internal control as they have determined 
necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of 
assets) or error. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of 
Managing Directors is responsible for assessing the Group's ability 
to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility 
for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In 
addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the 
going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
Furthermore, the Board of Managing Directors is responsible for 
the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, 
provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all 
material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial 
statements, complies with German legal requirements, and 
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future 
development. In addition, the Board of Managing Directors is 
responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they 
have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group 
management report that is in accordance with the applicable 
German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient 
appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management 
report. 
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements and of the group management report. 
 
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether 
the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate 
view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is 
consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the 
knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal 
requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and 
risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements 
and on the group management report. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 
HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German 
Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits 
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always 
detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements and this group management 
report. 
We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements and of the group management 
report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal controls. 
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit 
of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements 
and measures relevant to the audit of the group management 
report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. 
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the 
Board of Managing Directors and the reasonableness of 
estimates made by the Board of Managing Directors and related 
disclosures. 
• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Managing 
Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the 
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and 
in the group management report or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the consolidated financial statements present the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that the 
consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of 
the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant 
to Section 315e (1) HGB. 
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities within 
the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial 
statements and on the group management report. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions. 
• Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with 
the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with 
[German] law, and the view of the Group's position it provides. 
• Perform audit procedures on the prospective information 
presented by the Board of Managing Directors in the group 
management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions 
used by the Board of Managing Directors as a basis for the 
prospective information and evaluate the proper derivation of 
the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not 
express a separate opinion on the prospective information and 
on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial 
unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the 
prospective information. 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with the relevant independence 
requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or 
safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats. 
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter. 
Other Legal and Regulatory 
Requirements 
Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management 
Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with 
Section 317 (3a) HGB 
We have performed assurance work in accordance with Section 317 
(3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group 
management report (hereinafter the “ESEF documents”) contained 
in the electronic file "Commerzbank_AG_KA+KLB_ESEF-2023-12-
31_V5.zip" (SHA256-hash value: 4d7b9daea6db49b169d273bbae-
3d80054ea9e250f3af8c89e09ca660745a4944) made available and 
prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects 
with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic 
reporting format (“ESEF format”). In accordance with German legal 
requirements, this assurance work extends only to the conversion 
of the information contained in the consolidated financial 
statements and the group management report into the ESEF format 
and therefore relates neither to the information contained in these 
renderings nor to any other information contained in the file 
identified above. 
In our opinion, the rendering of the consolidated financial 
statements and the group management report contained in the 
electronic file made available, identified above and prepared for 
publication purposes complies in all material respects with the 
requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting

We conducted our assurance work on the rendering of the 
consolidated financial statements and the group management 
report contained in the file made available and identified above in 
accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB and the IDW Assurance 
Standard: Assurance Work on the Electronic Rendering of Financial 
Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication 
Purposes in Accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB (IDW AsS 410 
(06.2022)). Our responsibility in accordance therewith is further 
described below. Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on 
Quality Management 1: Requirements for Quality Management in 
Audit Firms (IDW QMS 1 (09.2022)). 
The Company's Board of Managing Directors is responsible for 
the preparation of the ESEF documents including the electronic 
rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group 
management report in accordance with Section 328 (1) sentence 4 
item 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with Section 328 (1) sentence 4 item 2 HGB. 
In addition, the Company's Board of Managing Directors is 
responsible for such internal control that they have considered 
necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are 
free from material - intentional or unintentional - non-compliance 
with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic 
reporting format. 
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the process 
of preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting 
process. 
Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the ESEF documents are free from material - intentional or 
unintentional - non-compliance with the requirements of Section 
328 (1) HGB. We exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the assurance work. We also: 
• Identify and assess the risks of material - intentional or 
unintentional - non-compliance with the requirements of Section 
328 (1) HGB, design and perform assurance procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance 
opinion. 
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the 
assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the 
effectiveness of these controls. 
• Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e. 
whether the file made available containing the ESEF documents 
meets the requirements of the Commission Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2019/815, as amended as at the reporting date, 
on the technical specification for this electronic file. 
• Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML 
rendering with content equivalent to the audited consolidated 
financial statements and the audited group management report. 
• Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline 
XBRL technology (iXBRL), in accordance with the requirements 
of Articles 4 and 6 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2019/815, as amended as at the reporting date, enables an 
appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the 
XHTML rendering.

To Commerzbank AG,  
Frankfurt/Main 
 
We have performed a limited assurance engagement of the 
consolidated non-financial group statement of COMMERZBANK 
Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main (hereinafter “company”) 
and the parent company's non-financial statement, which is 
combined with it, which are published in the form of a separate 
report outside the management report (hereinafter "combined 
separate non-financial report") for the period from 1 January 2023 
to 31 December 2023. 
Responsibilities of Management 
Management of the parent company is responsible for the 
preparation of the combined separate non-financial report in 
accordance with Section 340i (5) in conjunction with Section 315c 
in 
conjunction 
with 
Sections 
289c 
to 
289e 
HGB 
[“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code] and Article 8 of 
REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT 
AND OF THE COUNCIL of 18 June 2020 on establishing a 
framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending 
Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter the "EU Taxonomy 
Regulation") and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well 
as for making their own interpretation of the wording and terms 
contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts 
adopted thereunder as set out in section “Incorporating EU 
taxonomy” of the combined separate non-financial report. 
This responsibility includes the selection and application of 
appropriate 
non-financial 
reporting 
methods 
and 
making 
assumptions 
and 
estimates 
about 
individual 
non-financial 
disclosures of the Group that are reasonable in the circumstances. 
Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control 
as they consider necessary to enable the preparation of a 
combined separate non-financial report that is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
1 Our engagement applied to the German version of combined separate non-financial 
report. This text is a translation of the Independent Assurance Report issued in German, 
whereas the German text is authoritative. 
The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued 
thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to 
considerable 
interpretation 
uncertainties 
and 
for 
which 
clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, 
management has disclosed their interpretation of the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder 
in section “Incorporating EU taxonomy” of the combined separate 
non-financial report. They are responsible for the defensibility of 
this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate 
legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of 
the interpretation is subject to uncertainties. 
Independence and Quality Assurance of the 
Assurance Practitioner’s firm 
We have complied with the independence and quality assurance 
requirements set out in the national legal provisions and 
professional pronouncements, in particular the Professional Code 
for German Public Auditors and Chartered Accountants (in 
Germany) and the IDW Standard on Quality Management 1: 
Requirements for Quality Management in Audit Firms (IDW QMS 
1 (09.2022)). 
Responsibilities of the Assurance Practitioner 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited 
assurance on the combined separate non-financial report based on 
our assurance engagement. 
We conducted our assurance engagement in the form of a 
limited assurance engagement in accordance with International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): 
"Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information" issued by the IAASB.  
 
 
Limited Assurance Report of the 
Independent Auditor 
regarding the combined separate non- financial report1 
 
 
 
 
 
 
418 
Commerzbank Annual Report 2023 
 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance 
engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any 
matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that 
the company's combined separate non-financial report, has not 
been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 
340i (5) in conjunction with Section 315c in conjunction with 
Sections 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and 
the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation 
by management disclosed in section ”Incorporating EU taxonomy” 
of the combined separate non-financial report. 
In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed 
are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, 
and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is 
obtained. The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to 
the professional judgement of the assurance practitioner. 
In the course of our assurance engagement we have, among 
other things, performed the following assurance procedures and 
other activities: 
 
• Gain an understanding of the structure of the group´s 
sustainability organisation and stakeholder engagement. 
• Inquiries of group-level personnel who are responsible for the 
materiality analysis in order to understand the processes for 
determining 
material 
topics 
and 
respective 
reporting 
boundaries for COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft. 
• A risk analysis, including a media research, to identify relevant 
information 
on 
COMMERZBANK 
Aktiengesellschaft’s 
sustainability performance in the reporting period. 
• Identification of likely risks of material misstatement in the 
combined separate non-financial report. 
• Inquiries of relevant employees involved in the preparation of 
the combined separate non-financial report about the 
preparation process and about the internal control system 
related to this process. 
• Evaluation of the design and the implementation of systems 
and processes for the collection, processing and monitoring of 
disclosures, including data consolidation, on environmental, 
employee and social matters, respect for human rights, and 
combatting corruption and bribery. 
• Analytical assessment of the data and trends of the quantitative 
data reported by all sites for consolidation at Group-level. 
• Inquiries of Group-level personnel who are responsible for 
determining disclosures on concepts, due diligence processes, 
results and risks, performing internal control functions and 
consolidating disclosures. 
• Inquiries of responsible employees at group-level to gain an 
understanding of the procedure for determining the key 
performance indicators, including qualitative information in 
accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation. 
• Assessment of the design and implementation of systems and 
processes for the collection, processing and monitoring of key 
performance indicator data in accordance with the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation, including any supporting information to 
be provided in accordance with the relevant annexes. 
• Inspection of selected internal and external documents. 
• Evaluation of the presentation of the combined separate non-
financial report. 
 
In particular, the following audit procedures were performed to 
audit the PRB Report, that is contained in the combined separate 
non-financial report: 
 
• Consideration of the "key areas requiring limited assurance" 
identified in the PRB Guidance for Assurance Providers. 
• Inquiries of responsible personnel to obtain an understanding 
of for the process, organisation and internal controls relevant to 
the preparation and disclosure of the PRB Report. 
• Evaluation of the risk of material misstatement in the audited 
sections of the PRB Report. 
• Inspection of selected internal and external documents. 
• Reconciliation of material disclosures in the selected sections 
of the PRB Report with underlying documents, including 
requesting and reviewing supporting documentation. 
• Assessment of the accuracy of the references made in the PRB 
Report. 
 
The following procedures were not within the scope of the 
engagement: 
 
• An assessment of the nature of the non-financial information 
included in the PRB Report or the possible absence of 
significant non-financial information. 
• The scope of our work did not include an assessment of the 
adequacy of the processes and controls in place regarding the 
preparation of the PRB Report. 
• The scope of our work in relation to the PRB Report was 
limited to assessing whether the disclosed statements 
accurately 
represent 
actual 
steps 
taken 
and 
activities 
performed by COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft.

In determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of 
the EU Taxonomy Regulation, management is required to interpret 
undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined 
legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of 
their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement 
thereon are subject to uncertainties. 
Assurance Opinion 
Based on the assurance procedures performed and the evidence 
obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the combined separate non-financial report of 
COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft for the period from 1 January 
2023 to 31 December 2023 has not been prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with Section 340i (5) in conjunction with 
Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB and 
the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued 
thereunder as well as the interpretation by management as 
disclosed in section “Incorporating EU taxonomy” of the 
combined separate non-financial report.

Disclaimer 
Reservation regarding forward-looking 
statements 
This Annual Report contains forward-looking 
statements on Commerzbank’s business and 
earnings performance, which are based upon 
our current plans, estimates, forecasts and 
expectations. The statements entail risks and 
uncertainties, as there are a variety of factors 
that influence our business and to a great extent 
lie beyond our sphere of influence. Above all, 
these include the economic situation, the state 
of the financial markets worldwide and possible 
loan losses. Actual results and developments 
may, therefore, diverge considerably from our 
current assumptions, which, for this reason, are 
valid only at the time of publication. We 
undertake no obligation to revise our forward-
looking statements in the light of either new 
information or unexpected events.
